The law in question was the Immigration (Amendment) Act 2009, which aimed to reduce the amount of human trafficking by requiring hotels and other accommodation providers to document all guests staying more than one night. In addition to the temporary lodging requirement, the new law also allows immigration officers to search the premises of any hotel or other accommodation provider at any time. The purpose of the law was to make it easier to identify illegal migrants who may be staying in Hong Kong while coming from or leaving to Macau. This law also created a barrier between mainland China and Macau, as visitors were now required to have more consistent documentation verifying their purpose for visiting. \nThis was an important cultural exchange because it allowed members of the Pan-democracy camp, a group of political activists active in Hong Kong, to understand how the new law would affect them and those close to them. This understanding of the new law enabled members of the camp to make informed decisions related to their plans for travel and work in the cross-border area. By making an effort to understand the law, they also were able to use their knowledge for discussions with political leaders and advocate for the law’s amendment if needed. This cultural exchange highlighted the importance of understanding the local laws and acting responsibly when travelling from city-to-city in order to avoid penalties of the law. \nThis cultural exchange showed how citizens can come together to better understand a law that affects them and their family members, and moreover, how they can use this understanding to advocate for their rights and the rights of others. It is an example of how citizens can take a proactive stance in understanding and responding to laws imposed by their government."
