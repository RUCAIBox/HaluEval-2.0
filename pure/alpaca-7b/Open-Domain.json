The statute was challenged by a group of parents, teachers, and students who argued that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional and violated the Establishment Clause. In his opinion for the court, Justice Rehnquist wrote that the statute “invites the State to become a religious instructor, to prescribe certain forms of religious worship, and to compel the citizens to attend and participate in religious exercises.”\nJustice Rehnquist went on to write that “the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits any such involvement of the State in religious exercise.”\nThe decision in Jackson v. Bishop was a major victory for church-state separation and was one of the first Supreme Court decisions to clearly recognize the importance of the Establishment Clause.\nThe decision in Jackson v. Bishop was a major victory for church-state separation and was one of the first Supreme Court decisions to clearly recognize the importance of the Establishment Clause. By ruling that the statute violated the Establishment Clause, the Supreme Court affirmed that the government may not compel citizens to participate in religious activities.
