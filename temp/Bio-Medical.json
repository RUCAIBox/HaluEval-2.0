    "user_query": "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?",
    "bloom-7b1_response": "Notch receptors are transmembrane proteins that are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. The Notch receptors are composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains a number of cysteine-rich repeats that are involved in ligand binding. The transmembrane domain is followed by a short cytoplasmic domain that contains a conserved PEST sequence. The intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is a large protein that is cleaved by a protease, γ-secretase, to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1), which is a transcriptional activator. The NICD-CSL complex then activates the transcription of Notch target genes, such as HES1, HES5, and HEY1. The Notch signaling pathway is activated by the binding of the Notch ligand to the Notch receptor. The Notch ligand is a transmembrane protein that is cleaved by a metalloprotease, ADAM, to release the Notch extracellular domain. The Notch extracellular domain then binds to the Notch receptor. The Notch receptor is then cleaved by a γ-secretase complex to release the NICD. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the CSL transcription factor.

    "bloom-7b1_response": "The ryanodine receptor is a homotetramer composed of four identical subunits of approximately 50 kDa each. The subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion, with the N-terminal domains of the subunits facing each other and the C-terminal domains facing the cytoplasm. The N-terminal domains of the subunits are composed of two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop. The C-terminal domains are composed of a large intracellular loop and a short cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is a highly conserved sequence of approximately 30 amino acids that is rich in serine and threonine residues. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is thought to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the ryanodine receptor subunits and to be involved in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is also thought to interact with the calmodulin-binding protein, calmodulin, and to be involved in the regulation of the ryanodine receptor function.

    "llama-2-13b-hf_response": "Weaver syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth of the body and face, delayed development, and distinctive facial features. It is caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene.\nWhat is the difference between Sotos and Beckwith-Wiedemann?\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Sotos syndrome (SS) are two rare genetic disorders that are characterized by overgrowth of the body and face, as well as distinctive facial features.\nBWS is caused by abnormalities in the genes that regulate the growth of the body and face, while SS is caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene.\nBoth disorders can cause delayed development and other health problems, but the specific symptoms and severity can vary widely between individuals.\nWhat is the difference between Sotos and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?\nSotos syndrome (SS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) are two rare genetic disorders that are characterized by overgrowth of the body and face, as well as distinctive facial features.\nBoth disorders can cause delayed development and other health problems, but the specific symptoms and severity can vary widely between individuals.

    "llama-2-13b-hf_response": "Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are short sequences of DNA that are highly conserved across species. They are thought to be important for maintaining genome integrity and regulating gene expression. However, it is not clear whether UCEs are always transcribed into RNA.\nA recent study has found that UCEs are often transcribed into RNA, but the level of transcription varies between species. The study also found that the level of transcription is not always correlated with the level of conservation. This suggests that UCEs may have different functions in different species.\nThe study has important implications for our understanding of the role of UCEs in genome stability and gene regulation. It also highlights the need for further research into the function of UCEs in different species.\nWhat are ultraconserved elements?\nUltraconserved elements (UCEs) are short sequences of DNA that are highly conserved across species.
