    "user_query": "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?",
    "bloom-7b1_response": "Notch receptors are transmembrane proteins that are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. The Notch receptors are composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains a number of cysteine-rich repeats that are involved in ligand binding. The transmembrane domain is followed by a short cytoplasmic domain that contains a conserved PEST sequence. The intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is a large protein that is cleaved by a protease, γ-secretase, to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1), which is a transcriptional activator. The NICD-CSL complex then activates the transcription of Notch target genes, such as HES1, HES5, and HEY1. The Notch signaling pathway is activated by the binding of the Notch ligand to the Notch receptor. The Notch ligand is a transmembrane protein that is cleaved by a metalloprotease, ADAM, to release the Notch extracellular domain. The Notch extracellular domain then binds to the Notch receptor. The Notch receptor is then cleaved by a γ-secretase complex to release the NICD. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the CSL transcription factor.

    "bloom-7b1_response": "The ryanodine receptor is a homotetramer composed of four identical subunits of approximately 50 kDa each. The subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion, with the N-terminal domains of the subunits facing each other and the C-terminal domains facing the cytoplasm. The N-terminal domains of the subunits are composed of two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop. The C-terminal domains are composed of a large intracellular loop and a short cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is a highly conserved sequence of approximately 30 amino acids that is rich in serine and threonine residues. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is thought to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the ryanodine receptor subunits and to be involved in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is also thought to interact with the calmodulin-binding protein, calmodulin, and to be involved in the regulation of the ryanodine receptor function.

It encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the GLI family of proteins. Mutations in the GLI1 gene are associated with a number of different disorders, including isolated pituitary adenoma, basal cell carcinoma, and medulloblastoma.\nIsolated pituitary adenoma is a rare condition in which a non-functioning pituitary tumor develops in the absence of other pituitary or endocrine abnormalities. It is typically diagnosed in middle-aged adults and is associated with a number of different genetic mutations, including mutations in the GLI1 gene.\nBasal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is typically caused by mutations in the GLI1 gene. It is characterized by the development of small, slow-growing tumors on the skin or eyes.\nMedulloblastoma is a type of brain tumor that typically affects children and young adults. It is associated with mutations in the GLI1 gene, as well as other genes such as PTCH1 and SUFU.\nIn conclusion, mutations in the GLI1 gene are associated with a number of different disorders, including isolated pituitary adenoma, basal cell carcinoma, and medulloblastoma.

    "llama-2-13b-hf_response": "SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes. They work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, which leads to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This helps to lower blood sugar levels and improve glycemic control.\nSGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but like all medications, they can cause side effects. Some of the most common side effects include:\nUrinary tract infections: SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk of urinary tract infections, particularly in women. This is because the medication causes the body to excrete more glucose in the urine, which can create a favorable environment for bacteria to grow.\nGenital yeast infections: SGLT2 inhibitors can also increase the risk of genital yeast infections, particularly in women. This is because the medication can cause changes in the pH balance of the vagina, which can create a favorable environment for yeast to grow.\nKetoacidosis: SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk of ketoacidosis, a serious condition that can occur when the body produces too much ketones. This can be particularly dangerous for people with type 1 diabetes or those who are at risk for ketoacidosis.\nHypoglycemia: SGLT2 inhibitors can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. This is because the medication can cause the body to excrete more glucose in the urine, which can lead to a decrease in blood sugar levels.\nThirst: SGLT2 inhibitors can cause an increase in thirst, which can be a side effect of the medication.
