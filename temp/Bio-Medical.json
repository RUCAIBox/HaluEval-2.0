    "user_query": "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?",
    "bloom-7b1_response": "Notch receptors are transmembrane proteins that are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. The Notch receptors are composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains a number of cysteine-rich repeats that are involved in ligand binding. The transmembrane domain is followed by a short cytoplasmic domain that contains a conserved PEST sequence. The intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is a large protein that is cleaved by a protease, γ-secretase, to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1), which is a transcriptional activator. The NICD-CSL complex then activates the transcription of Notch target genes, such as HES1, HES5, and HEY1. The Notch signaling pathway is activated by the binding of the Notch ligand to the Notch receptor. The Notch ligand is a transmembrane protein that is cleaved by a metalloprotease, ADAM, to release the Notch extracellular domain. The Notch extracellular domain then binds to the Notch receptor. The Notch receptor is then cleaved by a γ-secretase complex to release the NICD. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the CSL transcription factor.

    "bloom-7b1_response": "The ryanodine receptor is a homotetramer composed of four identical subunits of approximately 50 kDa each. The subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion, with the N-terminal domains of the subunits facing each other and the C-terminal domains facing the cytoplasm. The N-terminal domains of the subunits are composed of two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop. The C-terminal domains are composed of a large intracellular loop and a short cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is a highly conserved sequence of approximately 30 amino acids that is rich in serine and threonine residues. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is thought to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the ryanodine receptor subunits and to be involved in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is also thought to interact with the calmodulin-binding protein, calmodulin, and to be involved in the regulation of the ryanodine receptor function. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is also thought to interact with the protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and protein kinase G. The cytoplasmic tail of the ryanodine receptor is also thought to interact with the protein phosphatase, protein phosphatase 1, and protein phosphatase 2A.
