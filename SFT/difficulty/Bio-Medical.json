    "llama-7b_response": "Thiazovivin is a synthetic antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. It does this by binding to the enzyme DNA gyrase, which is essential for the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This disruption of the enzyme's activity leads to the death of the bacteria."
