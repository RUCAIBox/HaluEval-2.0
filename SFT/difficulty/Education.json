The lanthanide elements are generally more stable than the actinide elements, which are more reactive. This is due to the lanthanide elements having a lower atomic mass and a fuller outer shell, making them less reactive. In contrast, the actinide elements have a higher atomic mass and a less complete outer shell, making them more reactive."

This is because water tends to be drawn from the area of lower concentration (the air) to the area of higher concentration (the plant tissue).
