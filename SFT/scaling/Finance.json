The mortgage interest deduction is a tax break that allows you to deduct the interest payments you make on your mortgage from your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket than the standard deduction. On the other hand, the standard deduction is a fixed amount of money that you can deduct from your taxable income each year. It is usually higher than the amount of money you would save from the mortgage interest deduction. Therefore, if your taxable income is lower than the amount of the standard deduction, it may be more beneficial to take the standard deduction instead of the mortgage interest deduction."
