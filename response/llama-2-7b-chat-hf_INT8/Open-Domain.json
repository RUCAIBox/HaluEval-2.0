Levetus' lecture was significant because it helped to establish cooperatives as a distinct field of study and laid the groundwork for the development of modern cooperative movements.\nLevetus' lecture was based on her extensive research and analysis of cooperative movements around the world. She examined the ways in which cooperatives had evolved over time, from their origins in the early 19th century to their current forms and functions. Levetus also explored the various factors that influenced the growth and development of cooperatives, including social, economic, and political factors.\nOne of the key themes of Levetus' lecture was the importance of cooperative principles in shaping the organization and operation of cooperatives. She argued that cooperatives were distinct from other forms of business organization because they were based on principles of mutual aid, voluntary association, and collective ownership. These principles, Levetus believed, were essential for creating a more equitable and just society.\nLevetus' lecture was well-received by her audience, and it helped to establish her as a leading authority on cooperatives.
