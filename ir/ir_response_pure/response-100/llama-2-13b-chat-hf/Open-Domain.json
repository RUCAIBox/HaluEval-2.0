In 1873, he was awarded the Academy's gold medal for his painting of horses swimming.\nIn the 1880s, Bloch began painting en plein air and showed some elements of Impressionism in his work. However, concerned that his images were not realistic enough, he went to Paris to study with Léon Bonnat, where he practiced intensive croquis drawing to capture the basics of position and movement. This training in realism and Impressionism influenced his later work and helped him develop his unique style.\nBloch's paintings often depicted scenes of everyday life, landscapes, and animals, and he is considered one of the leading figures of the Danish Golden Age of painting.

    "llama-2-13b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in Document-0, the answer to the user's question is:\nThe Play of God is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play \"Othello\".\nIn the play, Desdemona, the daughter of a Venetian senator, elopes with Othello, a black man who is several years her senior. The story revolves around Othello's jealousy and eventual tragic downfall, fueled by Iago's manipulation and Desdemona's love for him.\nIn the adaptation, the character of Montgomery is reminiscent of Othello, as both characters are outsiders who are marginalized and ostracized due to their race and physical disability, respectively. Montgomery's lip reading ability and his desire to help others anonymously can be seen as a metaphor for Othello's position of power and his ultimately futile attempts to control the events that unfold.\nThe mention of Grace Blair and her sacrifice also echoes the character of Desdemona, who ultimately chooses to stay with Othello despite his flaws and the danger that surrounds her. The conversation between Grace and Harold Van Adam, in which she confesses her love for him but cannot leave Montgomery because of his handicap, parallels the scene in which Desdemona confesses her love for Othello and decides to stay with him despite the risks.\nOverall, the adaptation of \"Othello\" in \"The Play of God\" explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the destructive nature of jealousy, while also delving into issues of race, class, and disability."
