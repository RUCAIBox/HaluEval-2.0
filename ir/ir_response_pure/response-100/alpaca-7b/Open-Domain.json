He was familiar with the animal portraits of Johan Thomas Lundbye and the 17th-century painter Paulus Potter. In 1873, he was awarded the gold medal for his painting of horses swimming. In the 1880s, he began painting en plein aire and began to show some elements of Impressionism. At the age of thirty-five, concerned that his images were not realistic enough, he went to Paris to study with Léon Bonnat. There, he practiced intensive croquis drawing; to capture the basics of position and movement."
