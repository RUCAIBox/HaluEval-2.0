    "alpaca-7b_response": "IRS pub 521 has all the information you need. \nExpenses reimbursed. If you are reimbursed for your expenses and you use the cash method of accounting, you can deduct your expenses either in the year you paid them or in the year you received the reimbursement. If you use the cash method of accounting, you can choose to deduct the expenses in the year you are reimbursed even though you paid the expenses in a different year. See Choosing when to deduct, next. \nIf you deduct your expenses and you receive the reimbursement in a later year, you must include the reimbursement in your income on Form 1040, line 21. This is not unusual. Anybody who moves near the end of the year can have this problem. \nThe 39 week time test also can be an issue that span over 2 tax years. I would take the deduction for the expenses as soon a I could, and then count the income in the later year if they pay me back. IF they do so before April 15th, then I would put them on the same tax form to make things easier."

For example, if you have held the original number of shares for more than one year, you will be taxed on the capital gains at the long-term capital gains rate, provided you hold on to the additional shares for more than one year. If you sell the additional shares at a loss, you can apply the loss to the original number of shares, provided you sell the additional shares within 30 days of the stock dividend."

It sounds like it's very unlikely the company is going to issue you a 1099 for invoices they never paid you. So you just file last year's taxes based on your income, which is the money you actually received. If they do pay you later, in the new year, you'll include that income on next year's tax return, and you would expect a 1099 at that time. \nSide note: not getting paid is unfortunately common for consultants and contractors. Take the first unpaid invoice and sue them in small claims court. After you win (and collect!), tell them you'll sue them for each unpaid invoice in turn until they pay you in full.

There is a worksheet in Publication 590 that has the details. You are always entitled to contribute to a Traditional IRA. The MAGI affects how much of your contribution is tax-deductible on that year's tax return, but not your eligibility to contribute. Both the above paragraphs assume that you have enough compensation (wages, salary, self-employment income) to contribute to an IRA: the contribution limit is $5500 or total compensation, whichever is smaller. (If you earned only $2K as wages, you can contribute all of it; not just your take-home pay which is what is left after Social Security and Medicare taxes, Federal taxes etc have been withheld from that $2K).

You may reimburse your employees by travel days, miles, or some other fixed allowance under the applicable revenue procedure. In these cases, your employee is considered to have accounted to you if your reimbursement doesn't exceed rates established by the Federal Government. The 2015 standard mileage rate for auto expenses was 57.5 cents per mile. The rate for 2016 is 54 cents per mile. The government per diem rates for meals and lodging in the continental United States can be found by visiting the U.S. General Services Administration website at www.GSA.gov and entering \"per diem rates\" in the search box. Other than the amount of these expenses, your employees' business expenses must be substantiated (for example, the business purpose of the travel or the number of business miles driven). For information on substantiation methods, see Pub. 463. If the per diem or allowance paid exceeds the amounts substantiated, you must report the excess amount as wages. This excess amount is subject to income tax with-holding and payment of social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes.

However, the process is more involved and requires stronger proof of identity and proof of purpose. If the customer is able to visit Europe and stay for a week or more, they have a better chance of opening an account. Additionally, there will be deposit and withdrawal limits and fees applicable, which are significantly stricter and larger for non-EU citizens. If the amounts are not large, it might not be worth it.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The tax liability account is a common thing. In my own books I track US-based social insurance (Medicare and Social Security) using such an account. At the time I pay an employee, a tax liability is incurred, increasing my tax liability account; at the same time, on the other end of the double-entry, I increase a tax expense account. Notably, though, the US IRS does not necessarily require that the tax is paid at the time it is incurred. In my case I incur a liability twice a month, but I only have to pay the taxes quarterly. So, between the time of incurring and the time of remitting/paying, the amount is held in the tax liability account. At the time that I remit payment to the IRS, the transaction will decrease both my checking account and also, on the other end of the double-entry, my liability account."

The risk-neutral probability is the probability of an event occurring given that it has already occurred in the past. This probability can be used to calculate the price of an option if the market is in a stable state, meaning that the probability of the event occurring is known. \nFor example, if a trader is considering buying a call option on a stock, they must take into account the risk-neutral probability of the stock price rising or falling. The trader must calculate the price of the option given the current market conditions, which includes the risk-neutral probability of the stock price rising or falling.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Financial investors buy derivatives and then hedge the position for a variety of reasons. One of the primary reasons is to gain exposure to a particular asset or market while managing the risk of the position. Derivatives can be used to gain exposure to an asset while limiting the amount of money at risk. For example, an investor may buy a call option on a stock that they believe will increase in value, but want to limit their risk to the strike price of the option. By buying the option, the investor can gain exposure to the stock while limiting their risk to the strike price. \nAnother reason investors may buy derivatives and then hedge the position is to gain access to liquidity. Derivatives can be used to gain exposure to an asset or market that may have limited liquidity. For example, an investor may want to buy a large number of shares of a stock, but the stock has limited liquidity and it may be difficult to find someone to sell the shares to. By buying a derivative, such as a call option, the investor can gain access to the liquidity of the option market. \nIn addition, investors may buy derivatives and then hedge the position to gain leverage. Derivatives can be used to gain leverage while limiting the amount of money at risk. For example, an investor may want to buy a large number of shares of a stock, but may not have the money to do so. By buying a call option, the investor can gain exposure to the stock while limiting their risk to the strike price of the option. \nFinally, investors may buy derivatives and then hedge the position to gain diversification. Derivatives can be used to diversify an investment portfolio by providing access to markets or assets that would otherwise be difficult to access. For example, an investor may want to diversify their portfolio by investing in international stocks, but may not have the money to do so. By buying a call option on an international stock, the investor can gain exposure to the stock while limiting their risk to the strike price of the option. \nOverall, investors buy derivatives and then hedge the position for a variety of reasons, including gaining exposure to a particular asset or market, accessing liquidity, gaining leverage, and diversifying an investment port"

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Big companies like Apple or Google are not included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index because the index is weighted by share price, which favors larger companies with more capital. This means a $100 stock has a bigger impact on the index than a $50 stock, which is not representative of the market. The S&P 500 index is market cap weighted, which means a $100 billion company has a bigger impact than a $50 billion company. This is why big companies are not included in the DJIA index."

The interest rate is the amount of money charged by the credit card company on top of the amount of the purchase. The balance of the card is the total amount of money available on the card. The amount of the purchase is the amount of money spent on the purchase. \nTo calculate the interest, you need to multiply the balance of the card by the amount of the purchase, then divide the result by the number of payments made. This will give you the amount of interest charged for each payment. Then, multiply the result by the number of payments remaining to get the total amount of interest charged.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The interest rate on the balance you'll be carrying will depend on the credit card. Most credit cards charge an interest rate of 10-20% per annum. The interest rate is calculated on the outstanding balance, which is the amount you owe minus any payments you have made. \nFor example, if you have an outstanding balance of $5000 and the interest rate is 10%, then you will pay $500 in interest per year. This means that it will take you longer to pay off the balance if you are only making minimum payments. To avoid this, you should aim to pay more than the minimum payment each month. \nIn addition, the more you spend on your credit card, the higher your balance will be and the more interest you will have to pay. For example, if you usually spend $5000 per month and you increase your spending to $5000 per month plus $5000 more, then your balance will be $10,000 and you will have to pay $1000 in interest. \nTherefore, it is important to be aware of how much you are spending and the interest rate of your credit card so that you can make informed decisions and manage your finances responsibly."

Generally, if the stock is held for more than one year, any profits are taxed as long-term capital gains at the lower rate, while if the stock is held for less than one year, any profits are taxed as ordinary income at the higher rate. Additionally, if the stock is sold at a loss, the loss can be used to offset any capital gains and reduce tax liability."

This is done by reducing the divisor, which is the inverse of the total number of shares in the index. For example, if a company in the DJIA pays a dividend of $100 million, the divisor would be reduced by $100 million.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "No, there are no investment strategies which take advantage of an in-the-money option price that incorporates no “time value”. This is because volatility is cumulative and with less time there is less cumulative volatility. The time value and option value are tied to the value of the underlying. The value of the underlying (stock) is quite influenced by volatility, the possible price movement in a given span of time. Thirty days of volatility has a much broader spread of values than two days, since each day benefits from the possible price change of the prior days. So if a stock could move up to +/- 1% in a day, then compounded after 5 days it could be +5%, +0%, or -5%. In other words, this is compounded volatility. Less time means far less volatility, which is geometric and not linear. Less volatility lowers the value of the underlying. See Black-Scholes for more technical discussion of this concept. A shorter timeframe until option expiration means there are fewer days of compounded volatility. So the expected change in the underlying will decrease geometrically."

This will force short sellers of the penny stocks to cover their shorts, which can cause the price to appreciate. For example, if a short seller is short 10,000 shares at .50, they would have to put up $25,000.00 in margin ($2.50 per share for stocks under $2.50). If the company announces a 3 to 1 split, the short investor would now have to come up with $50,000.00 in additional margin or be bought in.

The regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist, so you need to ask the broker what their practices are. Orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions, different orders would have to be made during the extended session.

In the US, dividends are taxed at a lower rate than regular income, so the effective growth rate after taxation is usually higher than the growth rate before taxation. \nDividend-paying companies tend to have stronger shareholders because the company has less capital and must \"play nice\" to get money either from new shares or from banks.

It could be that the company owns a subsidiary in a foreign country by the same name (a holding company), which sells its own stock on the local market. It is also possible for the same company to list shares of the same \"pool\" of stock on two different exchanges (the foreign exchange usually lists the stock in the corporation's home currency and the share prices are near-identical), or for a company to sell different portions of itself on different exchanges. However, these are much rarer; for tax liability and other cost purposes it's usually easier to keep American monies in America and Japanese monies in Japan by setting up two \"copies\" of yourself with one owning the other, and move money around between companies as necessary. Shares of one issue of one company's stock, on one exchange, are the same price regardless of where in the world you place a buy order from. However, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll pay the same actual value of currency for the stock. First off, you buy the stock in the listed currency, which means buying dollars (or Yen or Euros or GBP) with both a fluctuating exchange rate between currencies and a broker's fee (one of those cost savings that make it a good idea to charter subsidiaries; could you imagine millions a day in car sales moving from American dealers to Toyota of Japan, converted from USD to Yen, with a FOREX commission to be paid?).

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Companies can issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders by using a Dutch auction. In a Dutch auction, the company announces the number of shares it plans to issue and the price it intends to sell them at. The company then receives bids from investors, and sells the shares to the investors who have offered the highest price. This ensures that the company receives the maximum price for the shares, while ensuring that existing shareholders are not diluted."
