The lecture likely discussed the work of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch and Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, who are considered pioneers of the cooperative movement.\nDocument-0 provides a brief overview of the history of cooperatives, highlighting the contributions of Schulze-Delitzsch and Raiffeisen. Schulze-Delitzsch is credited with establishing the first cooperative bank in 1852 in urban areas, while Raiffeisen is known for his work in rural areas, founding the first rural cooperative bank in 1864. The document notes that while Schulze-Delitzsch is chronologically earlier, Raiffeisen has proven more influential over time, particularly in the development of credit unions.\nDocument-1 provides additional context on the origins of cooperatives in Britain. The friendly society, building society, and mutual savings bank were earlier forms of similar institutions that emerged in Britain. These organizations were established to provide financial services to their members, with a focus on mutual aid and cooperation.\nDocument-2 provides information on Robert Owen, who is considered the father of the cooperative movement. Owen was a Welshman who made his fortune in the cotton trade, but he was also a pioneer in the field of social reform.
