Minimalism is a style of classical music that emerged in the mid-20th century, characterized by its use of repetitive patterns and a steady pulse that defines and controls the music. John Adams, like other minimalists of his time such as Philip Glass, used this steady pulse as a common practice. The use of repetitive patterns and a steady pulse can be seen in Adams' work \"In C\" which was written by Terry Riley. The adoption of this style can be seen in the comparison of \"Phrygian Gates\" written in 1977 and \"Fearful Symmetries\" written eleven years later in 1988. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Adams started to add a new character to his music, something he called \"the Trickster.\" The Trickster allowed Adams to use the repetitive style in a more complex and varied way, adding a new dimension to his music."

The meeting was held at the Barbara estate in Apalachin, New York on November 14, 1957.\nThe Apalachin Summit was significant because it brought together leaders of different Mafia factions, who had previously been operating in isolation, and it marked the beginning of a new era of Mafia organization and expansion. The gathering was also significant because it was the first time that many of the attendees had met face-to-face, and it led to the formation of new alliances and partnerships between different Mafia families.\nThe Apalachin Summit was also significant because it brought increased scrutiny and attention from law enforcement authorities. The gathering was discovered by chance by a state trooper who was investigating a report of a stolen car, and the subsequent raid on Joseph Barbara's home led to the arrest and indictment of 58 Mafia figures.
