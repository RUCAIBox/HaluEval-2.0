    "text-davinci-003_response": "Hilda Margery Clarke began studying under L. S. Lowry in 1940, and quickly developed a strong bond with her teacher. She frequently visited Lowry at his home in Manchester, and gained substantial insight into his technique and philosophy of painting. Lowry was known to be a gruff, yet generous mentor, and it is clear that Clarke benefited greatly from his instruction. Lowry, who had frequently painted scenes featuring solitary figures, greatly inspired Clarke, who went on to specialize in the painting of solitary figures. Her strong use of line and texture further set her apart from other painters, and she quickly gained recognition for her unique style. In the 1950s, Clarke and her husband relocated to Southampton, where she continued to paint and exhibit her work. Today, Clarke is considered to be one of the finest British intuitive painters alive. Her work is represented in many private and public collections, with Angus Neill, Director of Felder Old Master & Modern Paintings, being an avid collector. Lowry's influence can still clearly be seen in Clarke's work, acting as a constant reminder that he played an integral role in her development as an artist."
