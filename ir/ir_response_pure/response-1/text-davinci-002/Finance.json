The key phrase is that these are accounting for the non-cash activities that contribute to net income.

Then, each year, you pay an additional .5% of the loan balance to the bank, who in turn remits that to the insurance company.

A company can be listed on multiple exchanges, which is known as a dual-listed company. This is a corporate structure in which two corporations function as a single operating business through a legal equalization agreement, but retain separate legal identities and stock exchange listings. \nThe shares of a DLC parents have claim to the exact same underlying cash flows. So in theory, the stock prices of these companies should move exactly the same. However, in practice, there can be differences between these prices.\nMore info on OTC exchanges can be found here - keep in mind this info is from the company that runs these listings. Over the counter stocks are held to a FAR lesser regulation standard. I would recommend doing further interdependent research before pursuing any action."

    "user_query": "How long should I keep my tax documents, and why?",
    "text-davinci-002_response": "As a general rule of thumb, most experts recommend that you keep tax-related documents for at least three years. This gives you plenty of time to file an amended return, if needed, and protects you in case the IRS audits your return and asks to see your records. \nThere are, however, some instances in which you may need to keep your records for longer than three years. For example, if you own a business or rental property, you should keep your records until the statute of limitations expires for that year's return. The statute of limitations is the period of time the IRS has to audits a return and assess additional taxes. For business returns, the statute of limitations is three years. For most individual tax returns, it's three years as well, but there are a few exceptions. For example, if you file a return claiming a loss from worthless securities or a bad debt deduction, the statute of limitations doesn't begin until the security or debt becomes worthless. \nIn addition, there are certain types of records you should keep indefinitely, such as records relating to real estate or stock transactions. These records can be used to determine your basis in the property, which is used to calculate your gain or loss when you sell the property. You should also keep records that document major life changes, such as birth certificates and marriage licenses, as well as records relating to any changes in your business, such as the incorporation of your company. \nThe bottom line is that you should keep your tax records as long as they're relevant to your current financial situation. Once a return is no longer relevant, you can probably shred it. But it's always better to err on the side of caution, so if you're unsure whether or not to keep a particular document, go ahead and hang on to it for a few more years, just to be safe."

This means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant, the \"Dow divisor\". The weight of a particular stock in the index is therefore proportional to its share price. Since the stock prices of big companies like Apple and Google are much higher than the stock prices of most other companies in the index, their inclusion would result in the index being disproportionately influenced by their stock price movements. Another reason why big companies are not included in the DJIA is that the index is fixed at 30 stocks, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Committee tries to maintain a balance between different sectors."

YTM is sometimes referred to as \"redemption yield.\" Yield to Maturity is the interest rate that equates the present value of all future payments from a bond with its current market price. Essentially, YTM is the return you earn if you hold a bond until it matures. \nTo calculate YTM, we start with the bond’s price, which is the present value of all future payments. We then use a trial-and-error method to come up with a discount rate (the YTM rate) that makes the present value of all payments equal the bond’s price."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "So,But with the alternating minimum/full payment plan, lenders will give special dispensation to customers so that they can maintain a good credit score and are not unduly stressed about their payments. All you have to do is simply make the minimum required payment until the full balance is paid. Credit card holders need not fear their inability to pay the full amount due on their monthly statements.\nFirst, you need to understand how credit card companies calculate interest. Typically, they use the daily average balance method. Under this method, they take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges, and subtract any payments or credits. They then calculate the daily periodic rate by dividing the annual percentage rate (APR) by 365, and multiply that by the average daily balance. Finally, they multiply the daily periodic rate by the number of days in the billing cycle, which is usually about 30. \nSo, if your APR is 15% and your average daily balance is $1,000, your daily periodic rate would be 0.04109% (15% divided by 365), and the interest charge for the month would be $16.87 ((0.0004109% times 1,000) times 30).\nThere are a couple of things to keep in mind when it comes to credit card interest. First, most credit card companies will waive the interest charge if you pay your balance in full by the due date. Second, if you only make the minimum payment, you'll be charged interest on the remaining balance. And finally, if you carry a balance from one month to the next, you'll be charged interest on that balance, plus any new purchases you make."

The UCCB is a taxable benefit, but it is not based on family income. All Canadian families with children under the age of 18 will receive the UCCB as long as they are resident in Canada."

It may not trade right away because there's no market maker or other trader currently willing to buy or sell the stock at that price, but the order will stay in the system until it can be matched with an opposing order.\nWhen you place a limit order, you're specifying the maximum price you're willing to pay to buy a stock (or the minimum price you're willing to accept to sell it).

    "text-davinci-002_response": "If you receive dividends on an investment, those are taxed. Dividends are generally taxed at a lower rate than other forms of income, but the specific tax implications will depend on the country in which you reside and the type of investment from which the dividends are paid. For example, in the United States, dividends from stocks are subject to a maximum tax rate of 20%, while dividends from mutual funds are typically taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "One \"gotcha\" to remember is that if you buy shares on or after the ex-date, you are still entitled to the dividend. \"But I didn't own the sharesCLAIM THE DIVIDEND!\" It doesn't matter - you are entitled to the dividend anyway. It's one of the \" perks\" of owning shares. Q: What does a Dividend “will not be quoted ex” mean? A:\nThis means that the dividend will not be paid out to shareholders who sold their shares before the ex-date. The ex-date is the date set by the exchange on which the dividend will be paid out, and is usually based on the record date (the date on which you must be a shareholder to receive the dividend). If you sell your shares before the ex-date, you will not be paid the dividend."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "There is no limit to the amount of money that can be gifted from Japan to India from a person who is not a blood relation. However, gifts from anyone other than a blood relation are subject to gift tax in India. If the amount of the gift is more than Rs 50,000/-, the recipient will have to declare the gift and pay taxes on it according to their tax bracket. It is important to be aware that scammers may pose as friends or family members in order to try and take advantage of people, so it is important to make sure that the person gifting the money is legitimate before accepting any money."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document 1: \nThe price of natural gas has been plummeting since the early 2000s. In 2001, the price of natural gas was $8.50 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), but by 2015, it had fallen to just $2.66 per mcf. There are a number of reasons for this. First, the fracking boom led to a huge increase in natural gas production, which outstripped demand and caused prices to fall. Second, the global recession led to a decrease in demand for energy, further pushing down prices. Third, warm weather in the US meant that there was less demand for natural gas for heating, also contributing to the price decline.\nDocument 2: \nThe price of natural gas has been plummeting since the early 2000s.

    "user_query": "Why sometimes payable date is BEFORE the ex-dividend date?",
    "text-davinci-002_response": "Dividends are typically paid out on a company's stock on a quarterly basis, but the specific date of payment varies depending on the company. Some companies actually do pay their dividends on the ex-dividend date, but others have a date that is a few days or even a week before the ex-dividend date. The payable date is typically set by the company's board of directors.\nThere are a few reasons why a company might choose to set the payable date before the ex-dividend date. One reason is that the company wants to make sure that shareholders who are entitled to the dividend actually receive the payment. By setting the payable date a few days or even a week before the ex-dividend date, the company can be sure that the shareholders will get the payment even if there is a delay in processing the dividend.\nAnother reason why a company might choose to set the payable date before the ex-dividend date is to give shareholders more time to reinvest their dividends. If the payable date is set too close to the ex-dividend date, shareholders might not have enough time to reinvest their dividends before the share price goes down. By setting the payable date a few days or even a week before the ex-dividend date, shareholders have more time to reinvest their dividends and potentially make more money."

Source: Former Investment Bank Employee, 2012.\nInvestment banks need ratings from agencies in order to push through with fixed income issuance, and if rating agencies refuse to rate a product, it will be far less likely to participate and will demand higher rates of return. This means that while ratings need to be more independent, they also need to be credible in order to be effective."

This can happen when a company splits its stock, or when a company reorganizes its structure and creates a new class of stock. In some cases, the 100% stock dividend may be for the same type of stock, in which case it is basically the same as a 2-for-1 stock split. In other cases, the 100% stock dividend may be for a different type of stock, which typically happens during a corporate reorganization or demerger/spinoff event. The tax treatment for these events varies from country to country."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: \"There are several reasons. One, mutual funds provide instant diversification.  To build a diverse portfolio \"\"manually\"\" (by buying individual shares) requires more time and effort than buying shares of a mutual fund.  If your portfolio is not diverse, then it is wrong to say \"\"buying shares gives higher return\"\"; in many cases diversification will increase your returns. \nTwo,mutual funds reduce transactions costs.  If you buy individual shares, you pay transactions costs every time you buy or sell.  If you buy and sell the shares of many companies, you must perform many transactions and thus incur heavy fees.  With mutual funds, a single transaction gets you access to many companies.  In addition, it is often possible to buy mutual funds without paying transactions costs at all (although you will still pay fund expenses). \nThree, (sort of a combination of the previous two) it is just easier.  Many people can easily buy mutual funds with no cost and little effort through their bank.  It is also simple to set up auto-investment plans so that you automatically save money over time.  All of these things are much more complicated if you try to buy many individual shares. \nFour, if you buy the right kinds of funds (low-cost index funds), it is probably more lucrative than buying individual shares.  The odds that, through carefully selected stock-buying, you will earn more than the market average are small.  Even professional stock-pickers consistently underperform broad market indexes. In short, it is not true that \"\"buying shares gives higher return\"\", and even if it were, the convenience and diversification of mutual funds would still be good reasons to use them.\"\nThere does not appear to be a difference between the two documents."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Stock splits happen when a company's stock price gets too high and is beyond the price levels of similar companies in their sector. The reason companies do this is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors, even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. However, stock splits are usually initiated after a large run up in share price, and they don't necessarily lead to higher stock prices. What is true is that stock splits increase the liquidity of a stock; there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $10 than 1 share at $100. Some companies have the opposite strategy: by refusing to split the stock and keeping the price high, they reduce trading volume. Berkshire Hathaway is a notable example of this."
