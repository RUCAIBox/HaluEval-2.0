    "text-davinci-002_response": "ایران ایرosponsors the operation of Iran Air Tours as a means of supplementing revenue for the national airline. Iran Air Tours operates scheduled domestic services, under a codeshare agreement with Iran Air, using a small fleet of Tu-154Ms. Produced in the 1980s, the Tupolev Tu-154 was one of the last Soviet-designed passenger airliners put into production. Derived from the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 entered service in 1972. The Tu-154M, introduced in 1982, was a modernised production derivative. As the Su-24 is a military aircraft, its approach would have been controlled by military air traffic controllers, while EP-ITD's was controlled by civilian ATC. The Su-24 was supposed to land on runway 29L while the Tu-154 was supposed to take off on runway 29R about 2 minutes after the fighter landed. The military pilot of the fighter aircraft failed to reduce speed after landing and overran the runway. At the same time, Iran Air Tours Flight 956 was taxiing onto runway 29R. The flight was cleared for takeoff, after the pilots of the Tu-154 were informed that there was a military aircraft on the runway and that they should \"proceed without delay\". The military pilot of the fighter aircraft contacted Mehrabad Tower and was told to vacate the runway through the taxiway to his right. The fighter aircraft lost its tail when it mounted the embankment just beyond the runway, causing the fuel tanks to ignite. The fighter broke in two and burst into flames, which were quickly fanned by the jet blast of the Tu-154 taking off. The aircraft's afterburner, intended to enhance acceleration on takeoff, likely further increased the intensity of the blaze. The fighter aircraft came to a halt in between runways 29R and 29L. The front end of the fighter was pointing in the direction of oncoming air traffic. The Tu-154 sustained significant damage to its landing gear, left engine, and left wing root. The engine disconnected from the left wing, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. Nevertheless, the captain attempted to return to Mehrabad, unaware that the Su-24 was on fire. The aircraft crashed into a residential area known as Chaali, about 17 minutes after taking off from Mehrabad. The resulting fires killed all 119 passengers and 12 crew members on board the Tu-154, as well as the two pilots of the fighter aircraft. The"

The film features a number of Josef Locke's original recordings. Document-1: Josef Locke Josef Locke (born Joseph McLaughlin; 17 May 1898 – 15 October 1987) was an Irish tenor and actor, who became popular in Britain and America in the 1940s and 1950s. Locke was born in Coalisland, County Tyrone, Ireland, and became a singing success as a boy soprano in the Belfast boys choir. By the age of 16 he was working in the local coal mines and singing in working men's clubs. Locke began his stage career in 1926 and soon developed a popular act in working men's clubs and theatres in the north of England. He soon abandoned the coal mines to pursue a full-time career in music hall and variety. In the 1930s he toured with the biggest names in British variety and starred in a number of films. Locke achieved national fame in 1940 with the song \"My Isle of Golden Dreams\", which led to a string of hits and international concert appearances. In 1941 he moved to the United States, where he recorded a number of successful songs and starred in three Hollywood films. However, he was unable to sustain his American career and returned to Britain in the late 1940s. Locke resumed his musical hall and radio career in the 1950s and 1960s, but his health began to fail in the 1970s. From the internal knowledge, it is known that Adrian Dunbar is a Northern Ireland actor, musician, and writer.

They require a moderate amount of exercise which can range from short walks to unlimited stretching of their legs during a free run while hunting. They are not meant as guard dogs as they have been bred to consider everything a friend until an active scent indicates something different.\nThe Rough Collie is a Scottish breed of pastoral dog. It is perhaps best known through the character of Lassie, a Rough Collie portrayed in serial films and movies of the 20th century. Rough Collies are fairly large dogs; the American Kennel Club standard specifies an ideal height of 22 inches (56 cm) for dogs and 20 inches (51 cm) for bitches, with a permissible range of 1 inch (2.5 cm) above or below those heights. Silkies, or \"flat-coated Collies\", are shorter than Roughs, no more than 20 inches (51 cm) at the shoulder for either gender. Rough and Smooth Collies share a common ancestry, and there is no record of the two varieties being considered as distinct breeds until the 19th century.
