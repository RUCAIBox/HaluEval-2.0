For example, the document for a 401(k) plan can provide that participants can elect to defer any amount of their compensation (salary) BUT not to exceed ten percent (10%). Thus, someone whose salary is $50,000 per year will effectively be limited to deferring, at most, $5,000. Someone making $150,000 will effectively be limited to deferring, at most, $15,000.

Then, you can make a normal backdoor Roth IRA contribution (contribute to a Traditional IRA, then convert it to a Roth IRA). This will not be taxable because all of the Traditional IRA was non-deductible when you converted. \nThe second way is more complex and may require additional paperwork. You will need to re-characterize your original Roth IRA contribution as a Traditional IRA contribution, then convert it to a Roth IRA. This will be treated as if you made a Traditional IRA contribution originally, and then waited until now to convert. The earnings in the IRA up till now will be taxed on conversion. So in both cases, you will need to pay income tax on the earnings in the account up to now. The difference between the two is in the amount of money in the IRA now.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "No, using a cash account does not mean someone can trade all day on it. A cash account is a type of brokerage account where trades settle in three business days, meaning that the funds from the trade will not be available for trading until then. This rule does not prevent day trading, as a trader has all the information they need regarding the cash amounts that will hit their account three business days later. In a cash account, cash postings that arise from trading are treated as unsettled (for three days), but this does not mean that these funds are available for further trading. If someone has $25,000 in their account on day one, this does not mean that they will be able to trade more than $25,000 because their cash account has not yet been debited. Most cash accounts will include an item detailing \"Cash available for trading\" which will net out any unsettled business transacted. For example, if someone has a cash account balance of $25,000 on day one, and on the same day they purchase $10,000 worth of shares, then pending settlement in their cash account they will only have $15,000 \"Cash available for trading\". Similarly, if someone has a cash balance of $25,000 on day one, and on the same day they \"day trade\", purchasing $15,000 and selling $10,000 worth of shares, then they will have the net of $20,000 \"Cash available for trading\" ($20,000 = $25,000 - $15,000 + $10,000). If by \"prop account\" you mean an account where someone gives discretion to a broker to trade on their behalf, then the issues of accounting will be the least of their worries. They will need to be worried about not being fleeced out of their hard earned savings by someone far more interested in lining their own pockets than making money for them."

Pretty much all DLCs are cross-border, and have tax advantages for the corporations and their stockholders. When a DLC is created, in essence two companies are created and have two separate bodies of shareholders, but they agree to share all the risks and rewards of the ownership of all their operating businesses in a fixed proportion, laid out in a contract called an \"equalization agreement\". The shares of a DLC parents have claim to the exact same underlying cash flows. So in theory the stock prices of these companies should move exactly the same. However in practice there can be differences between these prices. More info on OTC exchanges can be found here - keep in mind this info is from the company that runs these listings. Over the counter stocks are held to a FAR lesser regulation standard. I would recommend doing further independent research before pursuing any action."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Deductions for gambling losses can be made on the individual's income tax return in the same year the losses were incurred. The deduction cannot exceed the amount of the gambling winnings. So, if a person has $100 in gambling winnings and $100 in gambling losses, the deduction can only be for the winnings. The losses cannot be deducted against other income."

Transit FSAs have $255 limits for each of {parking, public transit} per month, considered on a monthly basis separately; and that limit applies both to funding and to claims. You may fund your transit FSA with up to $255 per month for each purpose. You may withdraw up to $255 per month for each purpose. The amounts each month don't have to match, but they do need to each be under the maximum. Any amount you spend over $255 for either parking or public transit would need to be funded with post-tax money. Most transit FSAs have a mechanism for adding a credit card to the account to allow this to be seamless and on-demand (as opposed to be declared in advance). You can change your deduction each month, up to the limit your benefits provider permits (for me for example, I can choose up to the 10th of the prior month what to do).

Let's say they pay the 60% [either to you or to the seller]; The title is still with Seller as full payment is not made. Now if you default, the Bank has no recourse against the seller [who still owns the title] and you are not paying. Some Banks may allow a schedule where the 60/40 may be applied to every payment made. This would be case to case basis. The deal could be done with only paying 20% in the beginning to the buyer and then I have to pay EMI's of $7451. The lending company is offering you 1.1 million assuming that you are paying 700K and the title will be yours. This would safeguard the Banks interest. Now if you default, the Bank can take possession of the house and recover the funds, a distress sale may be mean the house goes for less than 1.8 M; say for 1.4 million. The Bank would take back the 1.1 million plus interest and other closing costs. So if you can close the deal by paying only 20%, Bank would ask you to close this first and then lend you any money.

At that time, Apple split its stock 7:1, and after that its stock price was a little under $100 per share. So, post-split Apple might be a candidate to be included in the Dow the next time they change up the components of the index. \nSince the Dow is fixed at 30 stocks, and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors, this probably wouldn't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason. (Correction: Apple is in the DJIA and has been for a little over a year now. Mea culpa.) \nThe Dow's price-weighting is unusual as stock indices go. Most indices are weighted by market capitalization. This means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value. This causes large companies like Apple to have a lot of influence on those indices, but since market capitalization isn't as arbitrary as stock price, most people see that as ok. \nAlso, notice that I said \"company\" and not \"stock\". When a company has multiple classes of share (as Google does), market-cap-weighted indices include all of the share classes, while the Dow has no provision for such situations, which is another, albeit less important, reason why Google isn't in the Dow. \nFinally, you might be wondering why the Dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations. The answer is that the Dow averages go back to 1896, when Charles Dow used to calculate the averages by hand. If your only tools are a pencil and paper, then a price-weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a"

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yield to maturity (YTM) is the rate of return on a bond that an investor receives for owning it until it matures. It is the discount rate at which the present value of all the cash flows from the bond is equal to the purchase price of the bond. YTM is the rate of return that the investor receives for holding the bond until it matures, and is equal to the coupon rate of the bond plus the current market value of the bond. The yield curve is a graph that plots the yield of bonds of different maturities against their maturity dates. It is a reflection of the current market value of the bonds, and shows the current market value of a bond given its maturity date. The yield curve typically flattens or inverts when creditors become more risk-averse and prefer to keep their money rather than lend it out. This can occur due to a sudden disruption in the market that causes uncertainty about the future, leading to an increase in the demand for cash on hand. The US government yield curve should be looked at with some reservation since there is a very large creditor to the US government that has the ability to loan the government an unlimited amount of funds."

Instead of trying to find credit card calculators, just use the more common mortgage calculator.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The butterfly trade strategy is a good strategy if the mid-strike price is past, because it allows the trader to pay less upfront while still capitalizing on a fall to the strike price. This is because the butterfly strategy involves the purchase of two verticals (one debit and one credit) which offsets the cost of the butterfly, making it the cheapest strategy to use if the trader is right and the stock price falls to the strike price."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Sell right away or hold?\nIf you are participating in an ESPP, and there is no required holding period, then selling the shares right away is the best option. This is because you are guaranteed a bonus with minimal risk. However, you should be aware that it may take a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage, and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop. If your discount is only 5%, for example, a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out.\nThe other pro of selling right away is that it simplifies your taxes and you are more likely to invest the money rather than spend it. On the other hand, if you choose to hold the shares, you will have to wait to receive the shares and there is no guarantee that the share price will not drop. Additionally, you will have to account for the ESPP contributions being withheld from your paycheck for months.\nOverall, selling the shares right away is the best option if there is no required holding period."

The regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist, so you need to ask the broker what their practices are. Orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions, different orders would have to be made during the extended session. Your stop order should execute if the normal market hour price stays below your stop price.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The corporation can issue more stock. However, that would dilute the value of existing shares. Thus, existing shareholders must vote to allow more shares to be issued. In the meantime, you'd need to wait for someone else to sell their shares."

    "user_query": "What is an exercise price in regards to restricted stock awards?",
    "alpaca-7b_response": "The exercise price for a restricted stock award is the same as the purchase price, which is usually the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. This is consistent with the Investopedia article, which states that the amount that must be declared for tax purposes is determined by subtracting the original purchase or exercise price of the stock (which may be zero) from the fair market value of the stock as of the date that the stock becomes fully vested."
