Both caspase 1 and neutrophil serine proteases such as proteinase 3 (PR3) can process pro-interleukin-1beta (proIL-1beta), a crucial cytokine linked to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. This study was undertaken to establish the relative importance of caspase 1 and serine proteases in mouse models of acute and chronic inflammatory arthritis.\nAcute and chronic arthritis were induced in caspase 1-/- mice, and the lack of caspase 1 was investigated for its effects on joint swelling, cartilage metabolism, and histopathologic features. In addition, caspase 1 activity was inhibited in mice lacking active cysteine proteases, and the effects of dual blockade of caspase 1 and serine proteases on arthritis severity and histopathologic features were evaluated.\nSurprisingly, caspase 1-/- mice, in a model of acute (neutrophil-dominated) arthritis, developed joint swelling to an extent similar to that in wild-type control mice. Joint fluid concentrations of bioactive IL-1beta were comparable in caspase 1-/- mice and controls. In contrast, induction of chronic arthritis (characterized by minimal numbers of neutrophils) in caspase 1-/- mice led to reduced joint inflammation and less cartilage damage, implying a caspase 1-dependent role in this process.\nIn mice lacking neutrophil serine PR3, inhibition of caspase 1 activity resulted in decreased bioactive IL-1beta concentrations in the synovial tissue and less suppression of chondrocyte anabolic function. In addition, dual blockade of both PR3 and caspase 1 led to protection against cartilage and bone destruction.\nThese findings suggest that inhibitors of caspase 1 are not able to interfere with the whole spectrum of IL-1"

It combines a vectorial representation of root objects with a powerful tracing algorithm that accommodates a wide range of image sources and quality. The root system is represented as a collection of roots (possibly connected) that are individually represented as parsimonious sets of connected segments. Pixel coordinates and gray level are converted into biological attributes such as segment diameter and orientation as well as distance to any other segment or topological position. This enables user interaction and data analysis to directly operate on biological entities (roots) and not be hampered by the spatially discrete, pixel-based nature of the original image. The software supports a sampling-based analysis of root system images, in which detailed information is collected on a limited number of roots selected by the user according to specific research requirements. The software is illustrated with a time-lapse analysis of cluster root formation in lupin (Lupinus albus) and an architectural analysis of the maize (Zea mays) root system. It is a freeware based on ImageJ and relies on cross-platform standards for communication with data-analysis software."

The gene encoding a putative NADPH:flavin oxidoreductase of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Eh34) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein (recEh34) has a molecular mass of about 35 kDa upon SDS/PAGE analysis, exhibits a flavoprotein-like absorption spectrum and contains 1 mol of non-covalently bound FMN per mol of protein. RecEh34 reveals two different enzymic activities. It catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as of disulphides such as 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and cystine. The disulphide reductase but not the H2O2-forming NADPH oxidase activity is inhibitable by sulphydryl-active compounds, indicating that a thiol component is part of the active site for the disulphide reductase activity, whereas for the H2O2-forming NADPH oxidase activity only the flavin is required. Compared with the recombinant protein, similar activities are present in amoebic extracts. Native Eh34 is active in a monomeric as well as in a dimeric state. In contrast to recEh34, no flavin was associated with the native protein. However, both NADPH oxidase as well as DTNB reductase activity were found to be dependent on the addition of FAD or FMN. This indicates that the flavin is not required for the NADPH oxidase activity, but is necessary for the DTNB reductase activity."

The sequence of a 2.6 kb genomic fragment containing gatA has been determined. An open reading frame of 1497 bp within this sequence is interrupted by three putative introns and predicts a protein of 55 kDa. Northern analysis confirms control of gatA RNA levels by amdR and also indicates that gatA is not strongly regulated by areA-mediated nitrogen metabolite repression. A. nidulans transformants containing multiple copies of a plasmid carrying an 88 bp fragment from the 5' untranscribed region of gatA grew poorly on substrates whose utilisation is dependent on genes controlled by amdR. This indicated titration of limiting amounts of the amdR gene product by this 88 bp fragment.

The C-terminal finger of GATA-1 shows a preference for an AGATAA binding site, while the N-terminal finger shows a preference for an AGATCT binding site, with an increased affinity attributed to N- and C-terminal flanking basic residues. The specificity for AGATAA over AGATCT arises from the C-terminal non-finger basic domain. Thus, the N-terminal finger binds preferentially to AGATAA once appended to the C-terminal arm of the C-terminal finger.

Four different HPC grades were used, with weight averaged molecular weights (Mw) of 30.0 (SSL), 55.0 (SL), 83.5 (L) and 365 (M) kg/mol. Results showed that the phase-separated structure changed from HPC-discontinuous to bicontinuous with increasing Mw of HPC. The film with the lowest Mw HPC (SSL) had unconnected oval-shaped HPC-rich domains, leaked almost no HPC and had the lowest water permeability. The remaining higher Mw films had connected complex-shaped pores, which resulted in higher permeabilities. The highest Mw film (M) had the smallest pores and very slow HPC leakage, which led to a slow increase in permeability. Films with grade L and SL released most of their HPC, yet the permeability of the L film was three times higher due to greater pore connectivity. It was concluded that the phase-separated microstructure, the level of pore percolation and the leakage rate of HPC will be affected by the choice of HPC Mw grade used in the film and this will in turn have strong impact on the film permeability."

It focuses on rice-pathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) strains and observes that codon pairs coding for individual RVDs are conserved to a similar degree as the flanking repeat sequence. It finds strong indications that TALEs may evolve by base substitutions in codon pairs coding for RVDs, by recombination of N-terminal or C-terminal regions of existing TALEs, or by deletion of individual TALE repeats, and proposes possible mechanisms. It also studies the effect of the presence/absence and evolutionary modifications of TALEs on transcriptional activation of putative target genes in rice, and finds that even single RVD swaps may lead to considerable differences in activation. This correlation allowed a refined prediction of TALE targets, which is the crucial step to decipher their virulence activity."

The response of the imaging system is dependent on incident radiation intensity and can be described to within 1% accuracy on central axis using a square root function. \nPortal dose measurements with the SLIC at the plane of the detector, on central axis of the beam using homogeneous attenuating phantom materials show that the imaging system is capable of measuring the portal (transmission) dose to within 3% of the ionization chamber results for homogeneous material. For two-dimensional dosimetry applications, the system is calibrated with a 10 cm Perspex block used as beam flattening material on the detector cassette to correct for variations in individual ion chamber sensitivity and the effect of nonuniform beam profiles produced by the flattening filter. Open and wedged dose profiles measured with the SLIC agreed with ion chamber measured profiles to within 3.5% accuracy."

The Gln223Arg polymorphism in the LEPR gene has been reported to alter receptor function and expression, both of which have been related with prognostics in several tumor types. This study used 315 DNA samples to genotype for the LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism and 87 primary oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas to assess for immunohistochemical expression. The results showed that homozygous LEPR Arg223 was associated with a 2-fold reduction in oral and oropharyngeal cancer risk, while the presence of the Arg223 allele in tumors was associated with worse disease-free and disease-specific survival. Low LEPR expression was also found to be an independent risk factor, increasing the risk for lymph node metastasis 4-fold. In conclusion, the Gln223Arg polymorphism and LEPR expression might be valuable markers for oral and oropharyngeal cancer, suggesting that LEPR might serve as a potential target for future therapies."

Phosphorylation of Ser-357 in the distal C-terminal Arg-354 or Ser-357 was found to be critical for the endocytosis of GPR15. Phosphorylation of Ser-357 was activated by multiple kinases, including PKA and PKC, and pharmacological activation of these kinases enhanced both phosphorylation of Ser-357 and endocytosis of GPR15.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The end products of the shikimate pathway are the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. These amino acids are essential for the synthesis of proteins and are not produced by other pathways. The shikimate pathway is unique to plants and some other organisms, and is absent in animals and fungi. The shikimate kinase encoded by the cDNA clones catalyzes the final step of the pathway, the phosphorylation of shikimate. This confirms the identity of the cDNA clones and demonstrates that the in-vitro synthesized peptide is a functional shikimate kinase. The N-terminal portion of the peptide is a transit peptide which directs the protein to the chloroplasts, where the shikimate pathway is located. Multiple sites of polyadenylation were observed in the mRNA, suggesting the existence of more than one shikimate kinase gene in tomato. These results are discussed with respect to the dual pathway hypothesis of the shikimate pathway in higher plants."
