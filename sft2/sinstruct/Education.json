However, if we have a circle with radius r and we want to cover it with circular pies, then the area of each pie will be (r/2)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So, if we want to cover the area of the circle with pies, then we need to have at least 4 times more pies than the radius of the circle. In other words, if we have a circle with radius r, then we need to have at least 4r pies to cover the area of the circle. However, if we have a circle with radius r and we want to calculate pi using the area of a circle formula area = pi * r^2 , then we need to divide the area of the circle by the radius of the circle. So, if we have a circle with radius r, then we need to divide 1 by r to get pi. But, if we have a circle with radius r and we want to cover the area of the circle with pies, then we need to multiply 1 by r to get pi.
