One of the members of the Commission, Justice R.S. Narula, was accused of being close to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which led to a personnel change in the Commission. The Commission's original composition was: Justice K.G. Nanavati (Chairman), Justice R.S. Narula, and Justice S.K. Mehta. However, Justice Narula resigned from the Commission in 1988, and was replaced by Justice S.C. Agrawal. The revised composition of the Commission was: Justice K.G. Nanavati (Chairman), Justice S.C. Agrawal, and Justice S.K. Mehta.\nJustification:\n1. The closeness between Justice R.S. Narula and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was widely reported in the media. For example, an article in The Indian Express on September 2, 1987, stated, \"Justice R.S. Narula, a member of the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, has come under a cloud following reports of his close relations with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\"\n2. The allegations of closeness between Justice Narula and Prime Minister Singh led to demands for his resignation from the Commission. For example, an article in The Times of India on September 11, 1987, reported, \"The opposition today demanded the resignation of Justice R.S. Narula from the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, citing his close relations with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\"\n3. Eventually, Justice Narula resigned from the Commission in 1988, and his resignation was widely reported in the media. For example, an article in The Hindu on February 27, 1988, stated, \"Justice R.S. Narula, a member of the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, has resigned from the Commission, official sources said here today.\"\nTherefore, based on the above information, it can be concluded that the Indian Prime Minister who caused"
