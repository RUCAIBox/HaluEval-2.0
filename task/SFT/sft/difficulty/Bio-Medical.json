This process is initiated when the bacteria enters a stationary phase, which is a dormant state where the bacteria is not actively growing. During this phase, the bacteria undergoes a series of genetic changes, such as point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which allow it to better survive in its environment. These changes are then passed on to the next generation, allowing the bacteria to better adapt to its environment."
