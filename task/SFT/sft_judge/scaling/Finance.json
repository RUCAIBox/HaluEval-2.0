    "llama-7b_response": "The Canadian federal government has implemented a system of income tax credits to ensure that all income is taxed at least once. This system is called the \"Canadian Dividend Refund System\" or CDRS. It works as follows:\n\nWhen a company pays out its profits as dividends, the shareholders of the company are taxed on those dividends at their marginal tax rate. This means that if you are in the 20% tax bracket, you will pay 20% tax on your dividend income. However, the government also allows companies to claim a tax credit for the money they pay out as dividends. This tax credit is called the \"Canadian Dividend Refund\" (CDR).\n\nThe CDR is calculated by taking the amount of dividend income paid out by the company and multiplying it by the \"refundable tax rate\" for the year. The refundable tax rate is the average of the marginal tax rates for all taxpayers in Canada. In 2018, the refundable tax rate was 26.75%. This means that for every $1.00 of dividend income paid out, the company can claim a tax credit of $26.75.\n\nSo, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you receive $100 in dividend income, you will pay $20 in tax on that income. However, the company will be able to claim a tax credit of $26.75, so you will actually end up with $73.25 in your bank account.",
