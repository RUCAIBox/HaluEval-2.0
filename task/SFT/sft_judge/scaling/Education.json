The smallest such network that satisfies this condition is a regular tetrahedron graph, which requires 4 nodes (rooms). However, in this graph, each node is connected to every other node, which means each room is connected to three others, but the total number of rooms is not the minimum required to satisfy the condition of each room having three connections. The minimum number of rooms to satisfy this condition without any room being connected to every other room is not possible because of the Handshaking Lemma, which states that in any graph, the number of vertices with an odd degree must be even. Since each room is supposed to have an odd number of connections (3), there must be an even number of such rooms, and 4 is not an even number.
