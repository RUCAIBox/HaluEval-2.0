FALSE [correction]: There is no universally accepted definition of a skyscraper's minimum height. The term \"skyscraper\" originally referred to buildings with steel frameworks that towered over other structures, and the height requirement has changed over time. Today, the term is often used for buildings that are particularly tall for their location or context, and the threshold for what constitutes a skyscraper can vary by country and organization.
