The reason is that the interest rate on student loans is much lower than the return you can get from investing in the stock market.

However, if you take out a studentW at 5% interest rate, then you will only need to pay $10,500 per year. So, it is better to take out a studentW than to invest in the stock market."

    "llama-7b_response": "Hi [Friend],\nI’m glad you asked me this question. I’ve been thinking about it for a while now, and have come up with a few ideas that might help you out.\nFirst of all, let’s talk about the taxation aspect of it. If you are receiving money from a friend in Italy, then it is most likely that you will be subject to taxation in both countries. This means that you will have to pay taxes on the money you receive in both India and Italy. However, there are some things you can do to reduce the amount of tax you pay. For example, if you are receiving a large sum of money, then you can split it into smaller installments and send them over a period of time. This will help you avoid paying tax on the entire amount at once.\nSecondly, you should also consider the fact that the value of your IND in Italy may depreciate over time. This means that if you convert your IND into EUR, you may end up with less money than you started with. To avoid this, you can try to keep your IND in a savings account until you are ready to travel. This way, you can be sure that the value of your IND will not depreciate too much.\nFinally, if you are worried about the safety of your money, then you can always use a service like Payoneer to send and receive money. Payoneer is a third- party service that allows you to send and receive money from anywhere in the world. They have a lot of different features that make them stand out from other similar services. For example, they offer free credit trans amounts, which means that you don’t have to pay any extra fees when sending or receiving money. They also offer competitive exchange ratesthat are much better than what you would get from your bank."

In this case, there would be 200 million outstanding humans and the price of each share would be cut in half."
