Casesin is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of 200 amino acids. It is then cleaved by pro protease to produce two polypeptides of 180 amino acids each. The smaller polypeptide is called Casesin K (CK), while the larger one is called Casesin L (CL). Casesin K is a serine protease that cleaves casein at specific sites to produce casein fragments with different molecu lar mass. Casesin L is a chymotrypsin, which cleaves casein at nonspecific sites."

    "llama-7b_response": "Viroids are non-template, single-stranded, non- coding RNA moleculesthat replicate via a hole-mediated mechanism. The replication process is initiated when a viroid binds to a host cell receptor. This leads to the formation of a virosome, which consists of the viroid and a number of host proteins. The virosome then undergoes a series of events that result in the production of multiple copies of the original viroid."

    "user_query": "You MUST give a detailed answer to the following question: What is the mode of action of Thiazovivin?",
    "llama-7b_response": "Thiazy Entertainmentivin is a prodrug of methotrexim, which is metaboxed to its active form, thiazyzovin (TFSI). TFSf is a potent inhibitor of dihyrofolate reductase (DHPCR), an enzyme that is required for the biosynthese of tetradeoynes (folates). DHPCR is overexpressed in many types of cance, including lung, colon, and leukemias. Inhibition of DHPCR leads to an increase in the intracellular concentrations of tetradeoynes, which are then trapped inside the cell by the folate receptor. This results in cell death."
