Influant viral infections or pixels can cause a decrease in pDC activity, leading to a decrease in the production of antivirus molecules.\n4. Peptides that selectively inhibit PTPR have been shown to increase the activity of pDCs in vitro.\n5. These peptides have been shown to be effective in boosting the activity of pDCs in vivo.\n6.
