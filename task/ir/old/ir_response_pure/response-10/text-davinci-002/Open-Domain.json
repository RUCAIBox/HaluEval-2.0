Hisclock began to tick when he bought the team from CBS in 1973 and – despite winning a total of 22 championships, including seven World Championships, in his 37 years at the helm – Steinbrenner was always searching for a new portal to bring success to the Yankees. While Yankee Stadium I is revered for its past and iconic presence, Steinbrenner lamented the venue's lack of luxury boxes and spending money to renovate the facility. One of the issues was actually with material that was used between 1923 to 1973, which seemingly reprinted pictures that came through a copy machine. So in May 1974, it ran color ads in the New York Times and New York Daily News to advertise the search for a new stadium. So unlike Steinbrenner, who openly asked to move, Kuhn was forced to exert pressure and essentially blackmail over civic leaders to allow the Yankees to improve their lives materially. http://www.foxsportsohio.com/11/11/10/A-look-at-George-Steinbrenners-journey-t/mlb_newyorkyank ees.html?blockID=554210 From 1961 to 1981, Mike Hart played for the American League Central team that played its games in Municipal Stadium.
