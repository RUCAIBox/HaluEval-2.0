    "alpaca-7b_response": "The Parker House Hotel in Boston was referred to as the \"King of the Wild Frontier\" by some guests due to its connection with the Boston & Maine Railroad. The original Parker House building and later architectural additions were demolished in the mid 1920s, and replaced in 1927 with a sleek, modern building, essentially the one that stands there today. One wing of the original 1855-1863 hotel remained open until the new building was completed in 1927, enabling the hotel to lay claim to being \"America's oldest operating hotel\". James Michael Curley, the charismatic, Irish-American \"Mayor of the Poor\" who dominated Boston politics for the first half of the twentieth century, was a constant presence at the Parker House, in part because Old Colony Street was a major hub of railroad activity."
