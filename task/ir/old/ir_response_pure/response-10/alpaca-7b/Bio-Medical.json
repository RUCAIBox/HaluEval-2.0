Hsp90 is an important regulator of Hsp70 and Hsp110, as it binds to the Hsp70 and Hsp110 proteins and helps to stabilize them. High hydrostatic pressure (HP) increases the levels of Hsp70 and Hsp110 by increasing the mRNA half-life, which is independent of HSF1 transcription factor activation.

Aurora B kinase is a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is activated by Cdh1. The recognition of Aurora B by APC/C-Cdh1 is specific and requires the presence of a conserved D-box at the COOH terminus of Aurora B. Furthermore, endogenous Aurora B and Cdh1 form a complex exclusively in mitotic cells. Degradation of Aurora B at the end of mitosis requires Cdh1 in vivo. This suggests that Aurora B is regulated both by its activation during early mitosis and by its destruction by APC/C-Cdh1 in late mitosis and in G1."

In particular, it has been shown that TRalpha1 and TRbeta mediate the regulatory effects of T3 and have profound effects on the cardiovascular system. We have analyzed the expression of the cardiac Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) genes alpha and beta in mouse strains deficient for one or several TR genes to identify specific regulatory functions of TRalpha1 and TRbeta. The results show that TRalpha1 deficiency, which slows the heart rate, causes chronic overexpression of MyHCbeta. However, MyHCbeta was still suppressible by T3 in both TRalpha1- and TRbeta-deficient mice, indicating that either receptor can mediate repression of MyHCbeta. T3-dependent induction of the positively regulated MyHCalpha gene was similar in both TRalpha1- and TRbeta-deficient mice. The data identify a specific role for TRalpha1 in the negative regulation of MyHCbeta, whereas TRalpha1 and TRbeta appear interchangeable for hormone-dependent induction of MyHCalpha. This suggests that TR isoforms exhibit distinct specificities in the genes that they regulate within a given tissue type. Thus, dysregulation of MyHCbeta is likely to contribute to the critical role of TRalpha1 in cardiac function."

It can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, or the ingestion of certain drugs, such as sulphonamides. In severe cases, scarring can result in blindness or residual scarring, and death may occasionally result from infection or renal failure. In pregnancy, bullous erythema multiforme can cause complete vaginal stenosis."

CNVs are widely distributed throughout the human genome and can contribute to genetic variation and phenotypic diversity. Spontaneous CNVs are a major cause of genetic and developmental disorders and arise frequently in cancer cells. Despite the importance of CNVs, there is limited understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms responsible for a large percentage of CNVs. Here, researchers report that low doses of hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and an important drug in the treatment of sickle cell disease and other diseases, induces a high frequency of de novo CNVs in cultured human cells that resemble pathogenic and aphidicolin-induced CNVs in size and breakpoint structure. These CNVs are distributed throughout the genome, with some hotspots of de novo CNV formation. Sequencing reveals that CNV breakpoint junctions are characterized by short microhomologies, blunt ends, and short insertions. These data provide direct experimental support for models of replication-error origins of CNVs and suggest that any agent or condition that leads to replication stress has the potential to induce deleterious CNVs. In addition, they point to a need for further study of the genomic consequences of the therapeutic use of hydroxyurea."

The precise site at which transcription starts was investigated for the avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd), the type species of the family of viroids with hammerhead ribozymes. Linear ASBVd (+) and (-) RNAs begin with a UAAAA sequence that maps to similar A+U-rich terminal loops in their predicted quasi-rod-like secondary structures. The sequences around the initiation sites of ASBVd, which replicates and accumulates in the chloroplast, are similar to the promoters of a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase (NEP), supporting the involvement of an NEP-like activity in ASBVd replication. Since RNA folding appears to be kinetically determined, the specific location of both ASBVd initiation sites provides a mechanistic insight into how the nascent ASBVd strands may fold in vivo. The approach used here, in vitro capping and RNase protection assays, may be useful for investigating the initiation sites of other small circular RNA replicons."

Transcriptomic analysis reveals that Topaz1 influences the expression of one hundred transcripts, most of which are up-regulated in mutant testis at post natal day 20.

Dysregulation of GATA-2 is a hallmark of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome, a malignancy that is defined by the combination of trisomy 21 and a GATA1 mutation. Here, we show that GATA-2 is required for normal megakaryocyte development as well as aberrant megakaryopoiesis in GATA-1 mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GATA-2 indirectly controls cell cycle progression in GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes. Genome-wide microarray analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that GATA-2 regulates a wide set of genes, including cell cycle regulators and megakaryocyte-specific genes. Surprisingly, GATA-2 also negatively regulates the expression of crucial myeloid transcription factors, such as Sfpi1 and Cebpa. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 prevents induction of a latent myeloid gene expression program. Thus, GATA-2 contributes to cell cycle progression and the maintenance of megakaryocyte identity of GATA-1-deficient cells, including GATA-1s-expressing fetal megakaryocyte progenitors. Moreover, our data reveal that overexpression of GATA-2 facilitates aberrant megakaryopoiesis."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The algorithm used for detection of long repeat expansions is Repeat expansion detection (RED). It is a powerful tool for detection of expanded repeat sequences in the genome. In RED, DNA serves as a template for a repeat-specific oligonucleotide. A thermostable ligase is used to ligate oligonucleotides that have annealed at adjacent positions, creating multimers in a thermal cycling procedure. The products are visualized after gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane and subsequently hybridized. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least square (PLS) techniques were used to reveal the most influential factors in the amplification reaction and to identify possible interacting factors. Ligation temperature proved to be the most important factor in the reaction: Temperatures far below the melting point of the oligonucleotide increased the yield considerably. Higher cycle number resulted in a continuous rise in intensity, indicating that the ligase remained active even after 700 cycles or 12 hr of cycling. In addition, the concentration of ligase was found to be important. Using optimal parameters, a 5.5- and 3.2-fold increase in the yield of 180- and 360-nucleotide products respectively was obtained. The improved sensitivity makes the method more robust and facilitates detection of repeat expansions. This improvement may be particularly useful in development of RED for diagnostic purposes as well as for nonradioactive detection of RED products."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The PDZ domain is a protein-protein interaction domain found in many proteins. It is believed to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein localization. In the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of SATB1, it was found that this domain resembles a ubiquitin domain instead of the previously proposed PDZ domain. This suggests that the N-terminal domain of SATB1 may have a different function than previously believed. Further studies are needed to determine the exact function of the N-terminal domain of SATB1."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The BLISS technique is based on the assumption that there is no effect from drug-drug interactions and compares the observed combination response (Y(O)) with the predicted combination response (Y(P)). It is based on the idea that if Y(O) is greater than Y(P), then there is a synergistic effect. This method lacks statistical rigor because it does not take into account the variability of the response measures and can frequently cause false-positive claims. To address this issue, the authors introduce a two-stage response surface model to describe the drug interaction across all dose combinations tested. This new method enables robust statistical testing for synergism at any dose combination, thus reducing the risk of false positives."

It is a gene that produces interferon-induced helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), which is involved in the production of type I interferon and plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of SLE. The gene variants in IFIH1 could abnormally activate antiviral defenses and increased type I interferon signaling. The present study validated associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IFIH1 and the pathogenesis of SLE. The results showed that rs1990760, rs3747517 and rs10930046 in IFIH1 were genotyped in 400 SLE patients and 659 health controls in Chinese cohort by an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique. Significant associations were observed between alleles of IFIH1 (rs1990760 C > T, P = 0.005, OR = 1.36, 95%CI = 1.10-1.69; rs3747517 T > C, P = 0.004, OR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.09-1.58, respectively) and SLE susceptibility. IFIH1 rs1990760 TT genotype carriers had lower serum levels of IL-18 (P < 0.001) and granzyme B (P < 0.001) than CC and CT genotype carriers. IFIH1 rs1990760 CT genotype carriers had higher anti-dsDNA-positive than CC and TT genotype carriers. In conclusion, IFIH1 polymorphisms (rs1990760 and rs3747517) were associated with SLE susceptibility and rs1990760 risk T allele related with IL-18 and granzyme B serum levels in SLE patients."

By understanding these genetic variations, researchers hope to be able to develop treatments and medicines that are more effective in certain populations. This project will help to address the ethnic bias that has been present in many previous genomic research studies, as it will provide a more comprehensive understanding of genetic variation and its effects on human health. Additionally, this project will provide valuable data on the genetic differences between Asian populations, which can help to inform social, cultural, and political understandings of identity in the 21st century."

These constructs reacted specifically to aromatic compounds but not to nonaromatic compounds, and we could detect, within minutes, micromolar concentrations of different aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene and toluene. The use of two different reporter genes allows the future construction of a multianalyte detection system for simultaneous monitoring of several pollutants.

Our system combines numerous sources of information (genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags and protein databases of related species) into a gene finder based on a hidden Markov model in a novel and systematic way. In our framework, various sources of information are expressed as partial probabilistic statements about positions in the sequence and their annotation. We then combine these into the final prediction via a quadratic programming method, which we show to be an extension of existing methods. Allowing only partial statements is key to our transparent handling of missing information and coping with the heterogeneous character of individual sources of information. In addition, we give a new method for modeling the length distribution of intergenic regions in hidden Markov models. \nRESULTS: On a commonly used test set, ExonHunter performs significantly better than the existing gene finders ROSETTA, SLAM and TWINSCAN, with more than two-thirds of genes predicted completely correctly. \nAVAILABILITY: Supplementary material available at http://www.bioinformatics.uwaterloo.ca/supplements/05eh/"
