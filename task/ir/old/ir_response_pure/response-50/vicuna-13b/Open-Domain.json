Tenskwatawa urged the Indians to reject the ways of the whites, including liquor, European-style clothing, and firearms. He also called for the tribes to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States.\nHowever, Tenskwatawa's movement was not universally accepted by the Native American tribes. Many Indians who were inclined to cooperate with the United States were accused of witchcraft and executed by Tenskwatawa's followers.

Gentianaceae, on the other hand, are distributed worldwide but most species occur in temperate zones. According to Merckx et al., the neotropics were an important area for the early diversification events in Gentianaceae, most of which occurring during the Eocene.

    "vicuna-13b_response": "Amelia Sarah Levetus gave a lecture at the University of Vienna in the late 19th century on the origins and history of cooperatives. The lecture likely focused on the application of cooperative principles to business organization, as well as the early developments in cooperative learning theory.\nCooperative learning theory, which was developed by researchers such as Allport, Watson, Shaw, and Mead, found that group work was more effective and efficient in terms of quantity, quality, and overall productivity when compared to working alone. This theory was further supported by researchers May and Doob in 1937, who found that people who cooperate and work together to achieve shared goals are more successful in attaining outcomes than those who strive independently to complete the same goals. Additionally, they found that independent achievers had a greater likelihood of displaying competitive behaviors.\nPhilosophers and psychologists in the 1930s and 1940s, such as John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, and Jean Piaget, also contributed to the development of cooperative learning theory. They emphasized the importance of social interaction and collaboration in the learning process, and their ideas have had a lasting impact on education and organizational theory.\nIn summary, Amelia Sarah Levetus's lecture on the origins and history of cooperatives likely focused on the early developments in cooperative learning theory and the application of cooperative principles to business organization. The lecture would have likely discussed the importance of social interaction and collaboration in achieving shared goals, and the impact of cooperative learning theory on education and organizational theory."

The code was compiled in the early 20th century, and it was influenced by several ideas and movements of the time, including the Garden City movement, Urban Renaissance, and the New Civic Architecture movement.\nThe Garden City movement, which originated in the late 19th century, advocated for the creation of planned, self-contained communities that were surrounded by greenbelts and had a strong emphasis on community living. The movement had a significant influence on the compilation of The Diritto Municipale, as it emphasized the importance of creating livable, sustainable communities that were designed to meet the needs of their residents.\nThe Urban Renaissance movement, which emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, was a response to the decline of many urban areas in Europe and North America. The movement advocated for the revitalization of urban centers through the creation of new housing, parks, and public spaces, as well as the restoration of historic buildings and structures. The movement also emphasized the importance of improving public transportation and increasing pedestrian and bicycle access to urban areas.\nThe New Civic Architecture movement, which emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, was a response to the perceived lack of quality in contemporary architecture and urban design. The movement emphasized the importance of creating buildings and public spaces that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and that were designed to meet the needs of their users.\nGabriele Tagliaventi, an Italian architect and a figure of the movement for the European Urban Renaissance and the New Urbanism in Europe, was a key figure in the compilation of The Diritto Municipale. Tagliaventi was the coordinator of the EU Program on medium-sized cities in 1993–1996 and a visiting professor at the University of Miami-School of Architecture in 1995–1997.
