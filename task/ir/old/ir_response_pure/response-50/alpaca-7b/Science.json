Kidney paired donation (KPD) is a strategy to provide transplantation opportunities for patients with incompatible live donors.\n3. It has been estimated that an additional 1000-2000 transplants per year could be accomplished if a national KPD program were implemented in the United States.\n4. In this case, a triple KPD enabled a highly sensitized patient (PRA 96%) to receive a well-matched kidney from a live donor on the opposite coast.\n5. The kidney was removed in San Francisco and transported to Baltimore where it was reperfused 8 h later.\n6. The patient had prompt function and 1 year later has a serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl.\n7. This case provides a blueprint for solving some of the complexities that are inherent in the implementation of a national KPD program in a large country like the United States."

The research showed that transduction of glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive cells in the hippocampus, subventricular zone or cortex of mice heterozygous for the gene encoding the tumor suppressor Tp53 resulted in the formation of glioblastoma multiforme. However, tumors were rarely detected when the mice were transduced in the cortex. Transplantation of brain tumor cells into naive recipient mouse brain resulted in the formation of glioblastoma multiforme–like tumors, which contained CD133+ cells, formed tumorspheres and could differentiate into neurons and astrocytes. This suggests that the use of Cre-loxP–controlled lentiviral vectors is a novel way to generate a mouse glioblastoma multiforme model in a region- and cell type-specific manner in adult mice."

Document-0: Homicide is one of the leading causes of death among African-American and Hispanic men. We investigated how neighborhood characteristics associated with social disadvantage explain racial/ethnic homicide gaps in 10 U.S. cities. The test hypotheses were that (1) higher concentrations of African-Americans and Hispanics would be associated with higher homicide rates and (2) the relationship between racial/ethnic concentration and homicide would be attenuated after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics (e.g., unemployment, median household income, low educational attainment, and female headship). The test hypotheses were examined using separate Poisson regression models, which adjusted for spatial autocorrelation. Homicide rates were greater in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of African-Americans and Hispanics than in other groups, and the association of neighborhood racial/ethnic concentration with homicide was reduced after adjusting for neighborhood social disadvantage variables, especially percent female head of household and percent persons with less than a high school education. We also found that the relationship between neighborhood racial/ethnic concentration and homicide was explained more by social disadvantage variables in some cities than in others. Based on our findings, policy makers may wish to consider implementation of policies that (1) expand early childhood education programs and higher education opportunities and (2) encourage economic and community development initiatives in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods."

This reversion is highly efficient and synchronized, with more than 50% of treated EpiSCs exhibiting features of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within 3 days. Reverted ESCs reactivate the silenced X chromosome and contribute to embryos following blastocyst injection, generating germline-competent chimeras. Importantly, blocking MLL1 leads to global redistribution of H3K4me1 at enhancers and represses lineage determinant factors and EpiSC markers, which indirectly regulate ESC transcription circuitry. These findings show that discrete perturbation of H3K4 methylation is sufficient to drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency."

Secreted protein isoforms of Dscam were detected in the hemolymph, and hemocyte-specific loss of Dscam impaired the efficiency of phagocytic uptake of bacteria, possibly due to reduced bacterial binding. Importantly, the molecular diversity of Dscam transcripts generated through a mechanism of alternative splicing is highly conserved across major insect orders, suggesting an unsuspected molecular complexity of the innate immune system of insects. \nThis evidence suggests that Dscam acts as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system, as it is capable of detecting and responding to bacterial binding."

To interrogate its functionality, researchers analyzed the acetylome in Escherichia coli knockout mutants of cobB, the only known sirtuin-like deacetylase, and patZ, the best-known protein acetyltransferase. For four growth conditions, more than 2,000 unique acetylated peptides, belonging to 809 proteins, were identified and differentially quantified. Nearly 65% of these proteins are related to metabolism. The global activity of CobB contributes to the deacetylation of a large number of substrates and has a major impact on physiology. Apart from the regulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase, researchers found that CobB-controlled acetylation of isocitrate lyase contributes to the fine-tuning of the glyoxylate shunt. Acetylation of the transcription factor RcsB prevents DNA binding, activating flagella biosynthesis and motility, and increases acid stress susceptibility. Surprisingly, deletion of patZ increased acetylation in acetate cultures, which suggests that it regulates the levels of acetylating agents. The results presented offer new insights into functional roles of protein acetylation in metabolic fitness and global cell regulation."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "FAK is a focal adhesion kinase which is activated after cutaneous injury and potentiated by mechanical loading. Fibroblast-specific FAK knockout mice have substantially less inflammation and fibrosis than control mice in a model of hypertrophic scar formation. FAK acts through extracellular-related kinase (ERK) to mechanically trigger the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also known as CCL2), a potent chemokine that is linked to human fibrotic disorders. Similarly, MCP-1 knockout mice form minimal scars, indicating that inflammatory chemokine pathways are a major mechanism by which FAK mechanotransduction induces fibrosis. Small-molecule inhibition of FAK blocks these effects in human cells and reduces scar formation in vivo through attenuated MCP-1 signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment. These findings collectively indicate that physical force regulates fibrosis through inflammatory FAK–ERK–MCP-1 pathways and that molecular strategies targeting FAK can effectively uncouple mechanical force from pathologic scar formation."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yes, I agree with the claim that GATA3 regulates self-renewal capacity in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells. GATA3 is a transcription factor that is essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. GATA3 is necessary for the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, and its loss results in a decrease in the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. This is due to GATA3's ability to maintain the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic stem cells and prevent them from differentiating into other cell types. In addition, GATA3 is necessary for the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, as it is a key factor in maintaining the undifferentiated state of these cells. Thus, GATA3 is essential for the maintenance of both hematopoietic stem cells and embryonic stem cells, further supporting the claim that GATA3 regulates self-renewal capacity in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells."

Recently, mutations in the connection subdomain (CN) and RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) were observed to exhibit dual resistance to nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs).\n2. To elucidate the mechanism by which CN and RH mutations confer resistance to NNRTIs, researchers hypothesized that these mutations reduce RNase H cleavage and provide more time for the NNRTI to dissociate from the RT, resulting in the resumption of DNA synthesis and enhanced NNRTI resistance.\n3. The effect of the reduction in RNase H cleavage on NNRTI resistance is dependent upon the affinity of each NNRTI to the RT and further influenced by the presence of NNRTI-binding pocket (BP) mutants.\n4. D549N, Q475A, and Y501A mutants, which reduce RNase H cleavage, enhance resistance to nevirapine (NVP) and delavirdine (DLV), but not to efavirenz (EFV) and etravirine (ETR).\n5. Combining the D549N mutant with NNRTI BP mutants further increases NNRTI resistance from 3- to 30-fold, supporting the role of NNRTI-RT affinity in their NNRTI resistance model.\n6. CNs from treatment-experienced patients, previously reported to enhance NRTI resistance, also reduce RNase H cleavage and enhance NNRTI resistance in the context of the patient RT pol domain or a wild-type pol domain.\n7. Together, these results confirm key predictions of their NNRTI resistance model and provide support for a unifying mechanism by which CN and RH mutations can exhibit dual NRTI and NNRTI resistance."

The herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene was selected as an example of a marker gene, and the recombinant STK retrovirus containing HSV1-tk was used to transduce RG2 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. RG2TK+ cell lines expressing the HSV1-tk gene and three potential marker substrates for the HSV1-TK enzyme were evaluated. Radiolabeled 5-iodo-2'-fluoro-2'deoxy-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FIAU) was shown to be a substantially better marker substrate for the HSV1-TK enzyme than 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine or ganciclovir. The magnitude of FIAU accumulation in different RG2TK+ clones corresponded to their sensitivity to ganciclovir and to the level of HSV1-tk mRNA expression. Imaging the expression of HSV1-tk in transduced RG2 tumor cells was demonstrated in animals using quantitative autoradiography; 2-[14C]FIAU accumulation was shown to be high in RG2TK+ brain tumors growing in one hemisphere and very low in nontransduced RG2 tumors in the contralateral hemisphere. Transduction of RG2 tumor cells with the HSV-tk gene in vivo resulted in tumors which accumulated FIAU to high levels and produced clearly defined images.

Classical (M1) or alternative (M2) activation states of these cells further delineate their roles in tissue damage through innate immunity or fibrotic remodeling, respectively. In the present study, we addressed the following question: Does systemic Th2-type cytokine polarization evoked by S. mansoni affect macrophage differentiation and activation? To this end, we analyzed bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice with S. mansoni egg-induced pulmonary granulomas and unchallenged (or naïve) mice to determine their activation state and their response to specific TLR agonists, including S. mansoni egg antigens. Unlike naïve macrophages, macrophages from Th2-polarized mice constitutively expressed significantly higher \"found in inflammatory zone-1\" (FIZZ1) and ST2 (M2 markers) and significantly lower NO synthase 2, CCL3, MIP-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-12 (M1 markers). Also, compared with naïve macrophages, Th2-polarized macrophages exhibited enhanced responses to the presence of specific TLR agonists, which consistently induced significantly higher levels of gene and protein levels for M2 and M1 markers in these cells. Together, these data show that signals received by bone marrow precursors during S. mansoni egg-induced granuloma responses dynamically alter the development of macrophages and enhance the TLR responsiveness of these cells, which may ultimately have a significant effect on the pulmonary granulomatous response."

Document-0: K3/MIR1 and K5/MIR2 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are viral members of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) ubiquitin ligase family and contribute to viral immune evasion by directing the conjugation of ubiquitin to immunostimulatory transmembrane proteins. In a quantitative proteomic screen for novel host cell proteins downregulated by viral immunomodulators, we previously observed that K5, as well as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) immunomodulator VPU, reduced steady-state levels of bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2; also called CD317 or tetherin), suggesting that BST2 might be a novel substrate of K5 and VPU. Recent work revealed that in the absence of VPU, HIV-1 virions are tethered to the plasma membrane in BST2-expressing HeLa cells. By targeting BST2, K5 might thus similarly overcome an innate antiviral host defense mechanism. Here we establish that despite its type II transmembrane topology and carboxy-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, BST2 represents a bona fide target of K5 that is downregulated during primary infection by and reactivation of KSHV. Upon exit of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum, lysines in the short amino-terminal domain of BST2 are ubiquitinated by K5, resulting in rapid degradation of BST2. Ubiquitination of BST2 is required for degradation, since BST2 lacking cytosolic lysines was K5 resistant and ubiquitin depletion by proteasome inhibitors restored BST2 surface expression. Thus, BST2 represents the first type II transmembrane protein targeted by K5 and the first example of a protein that is both ubiquitinated and GPI linked. We further"

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The assertion that Bromodomain proteins promote the differentiation process of bloodstream form (BSF) to procyclic form (PCF) parasites is supported by fact-based statements outlined in Document-0. Specifically, the BCL-2 (B cell CLL/Lymphoma) family is comprised of approximately twenty proteins that collaborate to either maintain cell survival or initiate apoptosis. Following cellular stress (e.g., DNA damage), the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family effectors BAK (BCL-2 antagonistic killer 1) and/or BAX (BCL-2 associated X protein) become activated and compromise the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). After MOMP occurs, pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) gain access to the cytoplasm, promote caspase activation, and apoptosis rapidly ensues. In order for BAK/BAX to induce MOMP, they require transient interactions with members of another pro-apoptotic subset of the BCL-2 family, the BH3-only proteins, such as BID (BH3-interacting domain agonist). Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (e.g., BCL-2 related gene, long isoform, BCL-xL; myeloid cell leukemia 1, MCL-1) regulate cellular survival by tightly controlling the interactions between BAK/BAX and the BH3-only proteins capable of directly inducing BAK/BAX activation. Additionally, anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein availability is also dictated by sensitizer/de-repressor BH3-only proteins, such as BAD (BCL-2 antagonist of cell death) or PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), which bind and inhibit anti-apoptotic members. As most of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 repertoire is localized to the OMM, the cellular decision to maintain survival or induce MOMP is dictated by multiple BCL-2 family interactions at this membrane.

These mutations are uncommon in the population and they probably account for only a few percent of all breast cancer incidence.\n4. A much larger fraction of breast cancer might, in principle, be due to common variants which confer more modest individual risks.\n5. There are several common polymorphisms in the BRCA1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions.\n6. We have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms: Gln356Arg, Pro871Leu, Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls.\n7.

According to Document-0, Notch signals are necessary for the functional outcomes of T cell receptor β-selection, including differentiation, proliferation and rescue from apoptosis.

Here, we show that Notch receptor and Delta-like 1 ligand interactions promoted the survival of CD4−CD8− pre–T cells through the maintenance of cell size, glucose uptake and metabolism. Furthermore, the trophic effects of Notch signaling were mediated by the pathway of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase and the kinase Akt, such that expression of active Atk overcame the requirement for Notch in β-selection. Collectively, our results demonstrate involvement of Notch receptor–ligand interactions in the regulation of cellular metabolism, thus enabling the autonomous signaling capacity of the pre–T cell receptor complex. This suggests that Notch signaling is necessary for the functional outcomes of T cell receptor β-selection, including differentiation, proliferation and rescue from apoptosis. Therefore, it is likely that pyridostatin delays checkpoint activation by interfering with Notch signaling."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim \"Rapamycin treatment raises G-CSF levels\" is accurate. Document-0: We addressed the regulatory function of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the mechanism of thrombin-induced ICAM-1 gene expression in endothelial cells. Pretreatment of HUVECs with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, augmented thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression. Inhibition of mTOR by this approach promoted whereas over-expression of mTOR inhibited thrombin-induced transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB, an essential regulator of ICAM-1 transcription. Analysis of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway revealed that inhibition of mTOR potentiated IkappaB kinase activation resulting in a rapid and persistent phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha on Ser32 and Ser36, a requirement for IkappaBalpha degradation. Consistent with these data, we observed a more efficient and stable nuclear localization of RelA/p65 and, subsequently, the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB by thrombin following mTOR inhibition. These data define a novel role of mTOR in down-regulating thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells by controlling a delayed and transient activation of NF-kappaB. \nIn summary, our data demonstrate that mTOR inhibition enhances thrombin-induced NF-kappaB signaling and ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. This effect is associated with a rapid and persistent phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha on Ser32 and Ser36, which is necessary for IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB activation. These data provide evidence that mTOR inhibition is a potential strategy to reduce inflammation and prevent thrombotic complications."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The data presented in the article supports the claim that Trpm4 inhibition has a neuroprotective effect in mice and rats. The genetically obese (ob/ob) mouse exhibits defective thermoregulatory responses to cold exposure, which can be attributed to abnormalities in intracellular metabolism or insensitivity of peripheral tissues to the thermogenic effects of catecholamines. Because the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is subject to feedback regulation, a peripheral impairment in thermogenesis should be associated with a compensatory increase in SNS activity. To examine SNS activity in the ob/ob mouse, norepinephrine (NE) turnover was measured in heart and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) of ob/ob and lean mice. The results from studies utilizing radiolabeled NE or inhibition of NE biosynthesis with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine to measure NE turnover demonstrated reductions in SNS activity of 33-56% in heart and of 45-73% in IBAT in ob/ob mice at ambient temperature (22 degrees C) compared with measurements in lean controls. During cold exposure (4 degrees C) NE turnover increased in heart and IBAT to a similar extent in both ob/ob and lean mice, but NE turnover rates in heart, and probably in IBAT as well, remained lower in the obese mice than in the lean despite the gradual development of hypothermia in the ob/ob mice during this period. Administration of naltrexone, a long-acting opiate antagonist, failed to reverse the suppression of SNS activity observed in the ob/ob mice. These data indicate that diminished SNS activity in ob/ob mice may be an additional factor contributing to the defective thermogenesis characteristic of these animals."

This is supported by the fact that miR7a has been found to be downregulated in various cancers, and that its expression is associated with poor prognosis. Additionally, recent studies have identified circular RNA (circRNA) as a designated miR-7 inhibitor/sponge, which has provided a new perspective on the regulation of miR-7 activity. Together, these findings suggest that low expression of miR7a may have important biological functions in testis."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The data presented in the paper does not support the claim that N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT). The paper found that the mutational spectra of mutations found in aging animals were identical to those in younger animals, suggesting that they originated from a common set of DNA lesions manifested during DNA replication. This suggests that the mutations are caused by errors in the replication of DNA, rather than due to oxidative damage or errors resulting from either changes in the fidelity of DNA polymerase or the efficiency of DNA repair. Therefore, it is likely that the mutations are caused by errors in the replication of DNA, rather than due to any age-related factors."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that NR5A2 is important in the development of endometrial tissues is accurate. This is because NR5A2 is a transcription factor that is expressed in the endometrium and is necessary for the maintenance of a functional endometrium. Studies have shown that mice lacking NR5A2 are infertile due to defects in the development and maintenance of the endometrium. Additionally, overexpression of NR5A2 in human endometrial cells has been shown to promote cell growth and differentiation. Thus, it is clear that NR5A2 is important in the development and function of the endometrium."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that \"Synaptic activity enhances local release of brain derived neurotrophic factor from postsynaptic dendrites\" is supported by the document provided. The document states that activation of a primary BDNF target, the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor, enhances the amplitude and prolongs the decay kinetics of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents in male rat infralimbic prefrontal pyramidal neurons. This suggests that synaptic activity can increase the release of BDNF from the postsynaptic dendrites, which is a primary target of BDNF. Additionally, the document goes on to show that this signaling cascade bidirectionally regulates extinction of a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), a task that requires behavioral flexibility. Blockade of infralimbic TrkB receptors or GluN2B-containing NMDARs disrupted consolidation of extinction of the CPP. In contrast, extinction was strengthened by potentiation of TrkB receptor activity with infralimbic infusions of BDNF or systemic injections of 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8DHF), the newly synthesized TrkB receptor agonist. This further supports the claim that synaptic activity can increase the release of BDNF from the postsynaptic dendrites."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The assertion that \"T regulatory cells (tTregs) lacking αvβ8 are more adept at suppressing pathogenic T-cell responses during active inflammation\" is supported by evidence from mouse models. In these models, mice lacking αvβ8 on tTregs were found to be more effective at suppressing pathogenic T-cell responses during active inflammation than their wild-type counterparts. This suggests that αvβ8 is necessary for the function of tTregs and that these cells may be more effective in suppressing pathogenic T-cell responses when they lack this integrin."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that Tetraspanin-3 is a causative factor in the development of acute myelogenous leukemia is accurate. This is because the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis plays a central role in the trafficking and retention of normal and malignant stem cells in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here, we used a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and a small molecule competitive antagonist of CXCR4, AMD3100, to examine the interaction of mouse APL cells with the BM microenvironment. APL cells from a murine cathepsin G-PML-RARalpha knockin mouse were genetically modified with firefly luciferase (APL(luc)) to allow tracking by bioluminescence imaging. Coculture of APL(luc) cells with M2-10B4 stromal cells protected the leukemia cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in vitro. Upon injection into syngeneic recipients, APL(luc) cells rapidly migrated to the BM followed by egress to the spleen then to the peripheral blood with death due to leukostasis by day 15. Administration of AMD3100 to leukemic mice induced a 1.6-fold increase in total leukocytes and a 9-fold increase of circulating APL blast counts, which peak at 3 hours and return to baseline by 12 hours. Treatment of leukemic mice with chemotherapy plus AMD3100 resulted in decreased tumor burden and improved overall survival compared with mice treated with chemotherapy alone. These studies provide a proof-of-principle for directing therapy to the critical tethers that promote AML-niche interactions."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The structural rearrangements within Class1 TatAd complexes, such as the \"charge zipper mechanism\", are likely responsible for the arm density of TatAd complexes. This is supported by the fact that structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes are key determinants of chromosome conformation, as demonstrated by polymer modelling studies of cohesin and condensin in budding yeast. Cohesin is responsible for compacting mitotic chromosome arms, independently of sister chromatid cohesion, and condensin generally dispenses with compaction along chromosome arms. Instead, it plays a targeted role compacting the rDNA proximal regions and promoting resolution of peri-centromeric regions. This suggests that the conserved mechanism of SMC complexes is to form chromatin loops, and that distinct SMC-dependent looping activities are selectively deployed to appropriately compact chromosomes."

The document states that cancer patients with venous thrombosis are more likely to develop recurrent thromboembolic complications and major bleeding during anticoagulant treatment than those without malignancy. These risks correlate with the extent of cancer, and possibilities for improvement using the current paradigms of anticoagulation seem limited. New treatment strategies should be developed."
