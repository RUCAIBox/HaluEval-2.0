The eel has a slimy skin â so slimy in fact that they have been known to slip out of fishermanâs hands on the end of the line! â so make sure you hold on tight. Document-1: Eels have a lifelong mission: to mate and to die. When itâs time to mate, the eelâ™s body chemistry changes dramatically. It fattens, turns yellowish-brown, and grows gills that suck oxygen directly from the water through the skin. It can only live now in freshwater. It develops a dotted line called a pheromone trail that guides other eels to the meeting place. Here the eels pair off, and each emits a ribbon of eggs and sperm. The parents die, the eggs hatch, and the larvae float out to sea. The larvae eventually settle in freshwater, where they begin to transform into eels. This metamorphosis takes many years. When these eels mature and return to the ocean, the cycle begins anew. \nThe feature that is determined only when an eel enters fresh water is its ability to mate."

With the Ideal Gas Law they're more or less independent, except in the denominator. Since volume and moles of gas are constant, then the temperature only decreases if the pressure decreases. However, in this case, since we know that the temperature of the gas does not change, we can use this to indicate that the pressure as well remains constant.ss What happens to the temperature when the pressure decreases ? The answer is A. the temperature increases. Explanation: The Ideal Gas Law assumes Devon Priestley believes that if the gas pressure decreases, then the molecules of the gas have a smaller average kinetic energy..'' So, if this happens, they would not collide a… The pressure, because the volume of a gas decreases when it is allowed to expand, will naturally decrease when atmospheric pressure decreases. A decrease of 1-mbar corresponds to a decrease of about 35-ft in atmospheric pressure. The pressure of a gas decreases as the height above sea level increases. Because y is inversely proportional to P … We know that demand must be less than, or in this case equal to, our potential output. With less demand, businesses react and produce less.

For example, when Romeo is banished from Verona, he believes that Juliet has died by her own hand, and so he plans to kill himself. However, Friar Lawrence manages to intercept Romeo and convince him that Juliet is not actually dead, but merely sleeping. The comedic relief provided by this scene stands in contrast to the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet's situation, and serves to intensify the emotional effect of the play."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Shapes in Euclidean geometry are classified according to some of their defining features, such as the number of sides in the case of polygons or the number of axes of symmetry in the case of circles. One important class of shapes is given by theregular polygons, which include the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular pentagon. An important property of regular polygons is that their sides and angles are all congruent. \nShapes can also be classified according to their symmetry. For example, the circle has infinite symmetry: if we draw a line through its center, we obtain an infinite number of lines of symmetry. The square has four lines of symmetry, and the equilateral triangle has three. \nOther shapes, such as the ellipse and the rectangle, have a different kind of symmetry, called bilateral symmetry: if we reflect them in a line, we obtain another image that is indistinguishable from the original.\nOne can also consider shapes that are not symmetric at all, such as the amoeba.\nShapes can be used to illustrate the concepts of even and odd in a few different ways. One way to do this is to consider the number of sides that a shape has. A shape with an even number of sides, like a square or a rectangle, is considered even. A shape with an odd number of sides, like a triangle or a pentagon, is considered odd. \nAnother way to think about even and odd shapes is in terms of symmetry. A shape that has bilateral symmetry, like a rectangle, is considered even. A shape that does not have bilateral symmetry, like a triangle, is considered odd. \nFinally, one can also think about even and odd shapes in terms of their vertices.

Representing the U.S. Figure Skating Association, she won the World Championship in ladies' singles in 1991 and the Olympic gold medal in the same event in 1992. Yamaguchi went on to win the U.S. ladies' singles championship twice more and retired from amateur competition in 1994 with six U.S. championships, two World titles, and an Olympic gold medal.\nDocument-1: 60-second bio: Kristi Yamaguchi. American figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi was born in Hayward, California, on July 12, 1971. The daughter of Jim Yamaguchi, a doctor, andCarolyn (Nakamura) Yamaguchi, a former flight attendant, Kristi was introduced to skating by her older sister, Lori.\nFrom an early age, Yamaguchi showed great promise as a skater. After winning the novice ladies' division of the U.S. Championships in 1986, she went on to take the junior title the following year. In 1988, she won the senior ladies' championship, becoming the first American woman in 16 years to claim the title.\nYamaguchi's successful career as a figure skater continued after she turned professional in 1994. In 1996, she won the World Professional Figure Skating Championships. The following year, she founded the Always Dream Foundation, a non-profit organization that benefits children.\nThe two documents indicate that Yamaguchi is of Japanese ancestry, was born in the United States, and spent part of her life growing up in Japan. However, when war broke out between the United States and Japan, Yamaguchi stayed in America rather than return to Japan, where her family was living.\nThere are several possible reasons why Yamaguchi might have stayed in America during the war. First, as a successful figure skater, she may have felt more attached to the United States, where she had achieved success and recognition. Additionally, Yamaguchi's parents were both born in the United States, so she may have felt more comfortable staying in the country of her birth. Finally, Yamaguchi's sister was still living in the United States at the time, so she may have chosen to stay in order to be close to her family."

Several described erroneously as living fossils turn out not to be real fossils at all but to be members of long-lived, continuous lineages.\"\nArctic glass sponges have been estimated by some to live as long as 70-80 thousand years, with some cuttlefish rumored to have lived even up to 100,000 years. However, it should be noted that the term \"living fossil\" is used somewhat loosely and refers to organisms that may not necessarily be true fossils (i.e. members of long-lived, continuous lineages)."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-0 does not directly answer the question, but it does provide some information that can be used to infer an answer. It states that water can be represented as an atomic structure, and that ice is the energy of the vacuum structure. It also states that there is a geometric relationship between space and the phase experienced by matter. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the ice structure has two sides: one side is the wave form (water or liquid), and the other side is the geometric (solid) side."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: The molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded covalently to a central oxygen. The angle between the two hydrogen atoms is approximately 104.5Â°, which gives the molecule a pyramidal (or tetrahedral) shape. The oxygen atom in water is slightly negative, while the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. The water molecule is thus said to be polar. \nIn the two-dimensional molecular picture of ice, four hydrogen atoms surround every oxygen atom, and each hydrogen atom is surrounded by two oxygen atoms. However, in reality, ice is three-dimensional and the most common structure of ice is called hexagonal ice, in which each oxygen atom is surrounded by four hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen atom is surrounded by two oxygen atoms. Therefore, our two-dimensional model is not a good approximation for the three-dimensional reality."

Some notable examples include Orson Welles' 1948 film adaptation, Roman Polanski's 1971 film adaptation, and the 2015 BBC television adaptation. Each of these versions has adapted the play in different ways, depending on the director's vision and the resources available at the time. For example, Welles' film is notable for its use of lighting and shadows to create a sense of foreboding, while Polanski's adaptation is more overtly violent and bloody. The 2015 BBC adaptation, on the other hand, set the action in a modern-day Scotland and made use of contemporary music to create a more contemporary feel."
