    "text-davinci-002_response": "Based on the two documents, it appears that Weaver syndrome and Sotos syndrome share some similar characteristics. Both are overgrowth syndromes characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, advanced bone age, and variable degrees of mental retardation. Additionally, both disorders have some sort of defect in the NSD1 gene. However, there are also some differences between the two syndromes. Weaver syndrome is also characterized by facial abnormalities, whereas Sotos syndrome is not. Additionally, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a distinct overgrowth condition characterized by macroglossia, abdominal-wall defects, visceromegaly, embryonic tumors, hemihyperplasia, ear anomalies, renal anomalies, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Deregulation of imprinted growth-regulatory genes within the 11p15 region is the major cause of BWS, whereas the molecular defect underlying a significant proportion of sporadic BWS cases remains unknown. Based on these differences, it appears that Weaver syndrome and Sotos syndrome are similar, but not identical, disorders."

Although a number of genome browsers are available for visualizing genome annotations, few offer the ability to generate high-quality images or to display data from transcriptome and microarray experiments. Results We present MGViewer, a Web-based genome browser that enables the interactive generation of chromosome wheels and linear genome maps. The generated images are in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format, which is suitable for creating high-quality scalable images and dynamic Web representations. In addition, gene-related data such as transcriptome and time-course microarray experiments can be superimposed on the maps for visual inspection. The MGViewer 1.0 is freely available at http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/MGV. Conclusions The Microbial Genome Viewer is a powerful open-source genome browser that offers unique features for visualizing genome annotations, transcriptome data and microarray experiments.\nThe Microbial Genome Viewer is available at http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/MGV."

Here, we examined the effects of site-specific mutations on the phosphorylation of tau by PKCI/ in vitro and in cellulo. Our results indicate that (i) the aPKC isoenzyme PKCI/ phosphorylates tau at multiple sites, (ii) Asp233 is the major aPKC phosphorylation site on tau in vitro and in cells, (iii) the PKC isoenzyme PKCI/ phosphorylates Asp233 of tau to a much greater extent than Thr231, and (iv) substrate proteins other than tau are also phosphorylated by PKCI/ in vitro.\nThere are three main branches of the CK1 family: the hhp1, hhp2, and DYRK1A genes.

The system uses data on the global morbidity risk of the resp. psychosis showing secondary cases similar (homotypical) to the index case and no increased incidence of cases of the other type. The classical schizophrenic subtypes differ in their global schizophrenia morbidity risk and show a tendency toward homotypical secondary cases. Monopolar and bipolar affective disorders were found to be very close together concerning family-genetic data-Schizo-affective psychotics were found to have among their relatives the highest incidence of all types of functional psychoses at all, a high rate of schizophrenics (esp. catatonic type) and affective psychotics and no homotypical secondary cases."

Currently, patients with diffuse BRCA mutations have been shown to respond well to platinum-based chemotherapy, but patients with somatic mutations in BRCA1 have shown to be unresponsive. \nDocument-2: Somatic mutations in BCL9L have been identified in several different cancers, but their role in cancer pathogenesis is unknown. We investigated the effects of BCL9L mutations in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), a cancer associated with poor prognosis. Ovarian clear cell carcinomas were sequenced for BCL9L mutations, and those with mutated BCL9L were analyzed for copy number alterations and DNA methylation. Of the 52 OCCC cases sequenced, 10 (19%) had somatic BCL9L mutations. All BCL9L-mutant tumors had copy number alterations in the 3q26.33 locus, including deletions of BCL9L, but no other genes in this locus were mutated. BCL9L-mutant and -wild-type tumors had similar DNA methylation patterns. In conclusion, our data show that somatic mutations in BCL9L are frequent in OCCC and are associated with specific copy number alterations, but not with global changes in DNA methylation.\nBRAF V600E somatic mutation is associated with mucinous morphology in endometrial cancer, although at a low frequency compared with KRAS mutations according to document 0. According to document 1, patients with diffuse BRCA mutations have been shown to respond well to platinum-based chemotherapy, but patients with somatic mutations in BRCA1 have shown to be unresponsive.

The molecular mass of the purified protein (His6-tagged at its N terminus) was identical to that of the testis inhibitor (19.0 kDa), as judged by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. The protein was strongly inhibited by Okadaic acid and by calyculin A but was not a substrate for protein phosphatases-1 and -2A. The protein was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (PKC) in the presence of ATP, as judged by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE, with a Km of 0.6 μM. The protein was a substrate for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) only in the presence of ATP (Km, 0.6 μM). The protein was not a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA) or for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A).\nDocument-43: Phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 on Thr34 by protein kinase C (PKC) decreases protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) inhibitory activity, whereas dephosphorylation of Thr34 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) increases inhibitory activity. However, the molecular bases for different effects of PKC and PKA on the inhibitory activity of inhibitor-1 have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of phosphorylation on the inhibitory activity of inhibitor-1 using a new PP-1 inhibitor, brain inhibitor-2/KAP (kinase- Associated protein), which is phosphorylated by both PKC and PKA. The results obtained showed that phosphorylation of Thr34 by PKC reduces the binding of inhibitor-1 to PP-1, whereas Thr34 phosphorylation by PKA does not affect this binding. The inhibitory activity of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated inhibitor-1 was further investigated.

In interphase cells, HuR binds to AU-rich element (ARE)-containing target mRNAs and regulates their stability and translation. However, the function of HuR in mitosis is largely unknown. Here, we show that HuR is rapidly imported into the nuclei of mitotic cells through the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and accumulates around chromatin. Interestingly, import of HuR into the nucleus is impaired in cells lacking the INM protein LBR, which is essential for nuclear lamina assembly. Furthermore, we find that depletion of LBR leads to disorganized mitotic chromatin and mitotic defects. Taken together, our data suggest that import of HuR into the nucleus via the INM is required for proper mitotic chromatin organization.\nFrom the two documents, it can be gathered that HuR does play a role in regulate the splicing process. This is particularly true in document 0, which discusses how HuR contributes to disease progression through post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. It is also worth noting that HuR is predominantly localized in the nucleus, but can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a cell cycle-dependent manner according to document 1."

Studies have shown that individuals with Ohdo syndrome have TTC8 mutations that lead to a decrease in the amount of functional TTC8 protein. This protein deficiency results in impaired development of the nervous system, which can lead to the intellectual disability, impaired communication, and autism spectrum disorder features seen in individuals with Ohdo syndrome.

On the basis of its known uridylation targets, the author hypothesized that Zcchc17 might regulate cell proliferation.\nConfirming this, loss-of-function and complementary gain-of-function experiments consistently revealed that Zcchc17 promotes the transition from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle. This activity takes place through both Rb-dependent and Rb-independent mechanisms by promoting the expression of multiple G(1)-associated proteins, including cyclins D(1) and A and CDK4.\nInterestingly, a Zcchc17 construct with point mutations inactivating the uridyltransferase domain enhanced cell proliferation as effectively as wild-type Zcchc17. Furthermore, truncated mutant constructs revealed that the cell cycle effects of Zcchc17 were driven by the N-terminal region of the protein that lacks the RNA-binding domains and uridyltransferase activity of the full protein. Therefore, the N-terminal portion of Zcchc17, which lacks nucleotidyltransferase capabilities, is biologically active and mediates a previously unrecognized role for Zcchc17 in facilitating cell proliferation."

The present study sought to find ways to enhance GPR37 trafficking to the cell surface to facilitate studies of GPR37 functional activity in heterologous cells. In truncation studies, it was found that removing the GPR37 N-terminus (NT) dramatically enhanced the receptor's plasma membrane insertion. Further studies on sequential NT truncations revealed that removing the first 210 amino acids increased the level of surface expression nearly as much as removal of the entire NT. In studies examining the effects of coexpression of GPR37 with a variety of other GPCRs, significant increases in the level of GPR37 surface expression were observed when the receptor was coexpressed with adenosine receptor A(2A)R or dopamine receptor D(2)R. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that full-length GPR37 and, to a greater extent, the truncated GPR37 were capable of robustly associating with D(2)R, resulting in modestly altered D(2)R affinity for both agonists and antagonists. In studies examining potential interactions of GPR37 with PDZ scaffolds, a specific interaction between GPR37 and syntenin-1 was observed, which resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of GPR37 surface expression in HEK-293 cells. These findings reveal three independent approaches (N-terminal truncation, coexpression with other receptors, and coexpression with syntenin-1) by which GPR37 surface trafficking in heterologous cells can be greatly enhanced to facilitate functional studies with this orphan receptor."

The expression of T-UCRs was significantly higher in gastric adenocarcinomas than in normal gastric mucosa. In addition, the expression of T-UCRs was significantly associated with tumor size, depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis.\nOf the T-UCRs analyzed, CCR5 and CXCR3 were the most frequently expressed in gastric adenocarcinomas. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that is known to be involved in the migration of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes. CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is known to be involved in the migration of Th1 lymphocytes.

Our results suggest that, in addition to its other roles in regulating telomere maintenance and genome stability, p16 coordinates the delivery of SirT6 substrates to appropriate sites of action by specifically targeting them to telomeres.\nDocument-2: It has recently been demonstrated that united aneuploidy and thrombocytopenia (UAT) can be successfully induced in iPSCs generated from skin fibroblasts of Atm-/- mice. Furthermore, these iPSCs can be differentiated into platelets in vitro and in vivo, providing a powerful model to study the mechanisms underlying the development of UAT. \nSAHFs are created when primary human fibroblasts undergo oncogene-induced or replicative senescence. This process is known as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) formation. The retinoblastoma (RB) protein has an important role in SAHF; cells that lack active RB pathway fail to form SAHF. However, the methylation of RB has been shown to impact the SAHF formation. When the lysine 810 residue (K810) is methylated, it inhibits the interaction of RB with the protein kinase CDK4 and results in reduced level of phosphorylation of RB at serine 807/811 (S807/811). This study highlights the role of JMJD3 as a novel inducer of SAHF formation through demethylating RB and provides new insights into the mechanisms of cellular senescence and SAHF assembly."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Through the use of array-CGH, it was discovered that ADAMTS8 is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene. The study found that ADAMTS8 is broadly expressed in normal tissues but is frequently downregulated or silenced by promoter methylation in common carcinoma cell lines, including nasopharyngeal, esophageal squamous cell, gastric, and colorectal carcinomas. Pharmacologic or genetic demethylation restored ADAMTS8 expression, indicating that promoter methylation mediates its silencing.\nAberrant methylation of ADAMTS8 was also detected in several types of primary tumors but rarely in normal tissues. Further functional studies showed that restoring ADAMTS8 expression suppressed tumor cell clonogenicity through inducing apoptosis. ADAMTS8 as a secreted protease inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling along with decreased levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK. The study found that ADAMTS8 disrupted actin stress fiber organization and inhibited tumor cell motility.\nThus, the data from the study demonstrate that ADAMTS8 metalloprotease acts as a functional tumor suppressor through antagonizing EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling, in addition to its previously reported anti-angiogenesis function, and is frequently methylated in common tumors."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: Thiazide diuretic drugs are a class of compounds including benzothiadiazines and benzothiadiazides. They act by inhibiting the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, which results in enhanced reabsorption of luminal calcium. This action is independent of plasma calcium concentration. Thiazides have been shown to increase bone mineral density and reduce the risk of fracture, although the mechanisms by which they exert these effects are not fully understood.\nThiazovivin is a thiazide diuretic.
