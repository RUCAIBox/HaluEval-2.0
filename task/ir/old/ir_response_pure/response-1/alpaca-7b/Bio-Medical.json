The fourth major release of the database includes 457 non-redundant, curated profiles derived from ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip whole-genome binding experiments and 177 yeast TF binding profiles. Additionally, three new special collections provide matrix profile data produced by recent alternative high-throughput approaches. The introduction of a yeast division brings the convenience of JASPAR to an active research community. Classification of TF families has been improved by adopting a new DNA-binding domain nomenclature and the changes in the database set the system ready for more rapid acquisition of new high-throughput data sources."

Incorporation of K254R into a recombinant PIV5 (rPIV5-P-K254R) resulted in a virus that grew to a lower titer and had lower levels of viral RNA synthesis and protein expression than wild-type PIV5, suggesting that sumoylation of the P protein at K254 is important for PIV5 growth."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Type 2 deiodinase (D2) is a low Km iodothyronine deiodinase that catalyzes the removal of a single iodine from the phenolic ring of T4 or rT3. We sequenced and subcloned the open reading frame from a partial complementary DNA (cDNA) clone (2.1 kilobases) prepared by Genethon (Z44085) from a human infant brain cDNA library. The open reading frame encodes a putative 273-amino acid protein of 31 kDa with greater than 70% similarity to the Rana catesbeiana D2 protein. Transient expression of the cDNA produces a low Km (5 nM for T4; 8 nM for rT3) propylthiouracil- and gold thioglucose-resistant 5'-deiodinase in 293-HEK cells. Human D2, like human type 1 (D1) and type 3 (D3) deiodinases, is a selenoenzyme, as evidenced by 1) the presence of two in-frame UGA codons (positions 133 and 266), 2) the synthesis of a 31-kDa 75Selabeled protein in D2 cDNA-transfected cells, and 3) the requirement for a 3'-selenocysteine incorporation sequence element for its translation. Unlike D1 and D3, we were not able to covalently label overexpressed D2 with N-bromoacetyl [125I]T3 or -T4. We found that the human D2 messenger RNA is 7-8 kilobases and is expressed in brain, placenta, and, surprisingly, cardiac and skeletal muscle. Type 2 deiodinase activity was also present in human skeletal muscle. These results indicate that there are unique features of D2 that distinguish it from the two other selenodeiodinases. The expression of D2 in muscle suggests that it could play a role in peripheral, as well as intracellular, T3 production."

A study was conducted which tested whether computer-based decision support (CBDS) could enhance the ability of primary care physicians (PCPs) to manage chronic pain. Structured summaries were generated for 50 chronic pain patients referred by PCPs to a pain clinic. A pain specialist used a decision support system to determine appropriate pain therapy and sent letters to the referring physicians outlining these recommendations. Separately, five board-certified PCPs used a CBDS system to \"treat\" the 50 cases. A successful outcome was defined as one in which new or adjusted therapies recommended by the software were acceptable to the PCPs (i.e., they would have prescribed it to the patient in actual practice). Two pain specialists reviewed the PCPs' outcomes and assigned medical appropriateness scores (0 = totally inappropriate to 10 = totally appropriate). One year later, the hospital database provided information on how the actual patients' pain was managed and the number of patients re-referred by their PCP to the pain clinic. On the basis of CBDS recommendations, the PCP subjects \"prescribed\" additional pain therapy in 213 of 250 evaluations (85%), with a medical appropriateness score of 5.5 +/- 0.1. Only 25% of these chronic pain patients were subsequently re-referred to the pain clinic within 1 yr.

Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions."

The presumed NADPH dehydrogenase function of the heterodimeric cytochrome b558 in the neutrophil oxidase complex has been investigated by combined photoaffinity labeling and immunoblot analysis of membrane proteins from bovine neutrophils. The photoaffinity probe was a radiolabeled analog of NADPH, [4-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)[3H]amino]butyryl]NADPH ([3H]azido-NADPH), and the antibodies were directed against the C-terminal regions of the two subunits of cytochrome b558. Plasma membrane vesicles obtained by differential centrifugation of bovine neutrophil homogenates were routinely used as a source of NADPH oxidase. They were permeabilized by sodium deoxycholate to facilitate the access of NADPH or its azido analog to the totality of the specific binding sites. In the absence of light, azido-NADPH behaved as a competitive inhibitor of NADPH oxidase with a Ki of 6 microM, and was able to bind to high-affinity specific binding sites with a Kd of 5-6 microM, indicating a higher affinity of the oxidase for the photoprobe than for the substrate NADPH (KM = 30-40 microM). Upon photolabeling, the oxidase was fully inactivated. Following resolution of the membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE, a predominant photolabeled protein band of 80-100 kDa was revealed, which coincided with the large subunit (beta) of cytochrome b558 identified by immunoblot in a parallel gel. The enzymatic deglycosylation of photolabeled neutrophil membranes shifted the masses of both the photolabeled band and the immunoreactive beta subunit from 80-100 to 55-65 kDa in accordance with the glycoprotein nature of the beta subunit."

With the exception of a small number of poly-A-, poly-G-, poly-GA-, and poly-GAAA-sequences (combined <0.5%), all pure GA-sequences of the mammals tested were unique individuals, contained several repeated short GA-containing motifs, and shared a common hexa-nucleotide spectrum. At most 2% of the human GA-sequences were transcribed into mRNAs; all others were not coding for proteins. Although this could have made them less subject to natural selection, they contained many [corrected] times fewer point mutations than one should expect from the genome at large. As to the presence of other sequences with similarly restricted base contents, there were approximately as many pure TC-sequences as pure GA-sequences, but many fewer pure AC-, TA, and TG-sequences. There were practically no pure GC-sequences. The functions of pure GA-sequences are not known.

The response of the imaging system is dependent on incident radiation intensity and can be described to within 1% accuracy on central axis using a square root function. \nPortal dose measurements with the SLIC at the plane of the detector, on central axis of the beam using homogeneous attenuating phantom materials show that the imaging system is capable of measuring the portal (transmission) dose to within 3% of the ionization chamber results for homogeneous material. For two-dimensional dosimetry applications, the system is calibrated with a 10 cm Perspex block used as beam flattening material on the detector cassette to correct for variations in individual ion chamber sensitivity and the effect of nonuniform beam profiles produced by the flattening filter.

The hydrophilicity of solid PPF/PNVP matrices loaded with acetazolamide (AZ) or timolol maleate (TM) was increased by adding various amounts of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or by increasing the amount of N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) in the polymer mixture prior to cross-linking.\n3. The in vitro release studies that utilized high-performance liquid chromatography for quantification revealed highly accelerated drug release from the matrices with increasing contents of the hydrophilic modifier.\n4. AZ was released from matrices containing 5% PEG in 56 days, which equals approximately 25% of the release period found for the unmodified matrices.\n5. A comparable acceleration in drug release was found for TM-loaded samples modified with 5% PEG.\n6. These studies further revealed that 1% PEG is sufficient to shorten the TM release duration by one-third.\n7. A significant acceleration in drug release was also found for the samples that were fabricated from a PPF-NVP mixture with increased NVP content.\n8. Matrix water content and erosion were assessed gravimetrically.\n9. Micro-computed tomography was used to image structural changes of the release systems and shed light on the drug-release mechanism.\n10.

In addition, prior exposure to AMPH was associated with an elevation in resting striatal dihydroxyphenlacetic acid (DOPAC) to DA ratios in female, but not male rats, suggesting a sex difference in one neurochemical correlate of sensitization. As a group, males were more variable and heterogeneous in their response to repeated AMPH treatment, because they were divisible into two neurochemically distinct subgroups on the basis of their change in behavior and females were not. This heterogeneity may make it more difficult to identify neurochemical correlates of sensitization in males. It is suggested that there is a sex difference in the responsiveness of brain DA systems to repetitive activation, and this contributes to individual variation in the susceptibility to sensitization."

Measures of acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain behaviors were not significantly different using separate groups of GPR151 loss-of-function mutant mice and wild-type controls. Galanin at concentrations between 100nM and 1000nM did not induce calcium signalling responses in ND7/23 cells transfected with GPR151.
