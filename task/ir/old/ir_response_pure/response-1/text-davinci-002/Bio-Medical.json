They are both childhood overgrowth syndromes that are characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, height and head circumference >97th percentile, advanced bone age, and developmental delay. The main difference between the two syndromes is that Weaver syndrome has its own distinctive facial gestalt. A study that evaluated 75 patients with childhood overgrowth found that 28 of 37 (76%) patients in group 1 (Sotos syndrome) had NSD1 mutations or deletions, whereas none of the patients in group 4 (Weaver syndrome) had abnormalities of NSD1. The study also found that three patients with Weaver syndrome had NSD1 mutations, all between amino acids 2142 and 2184."

To further characterize the complex function of Twist1 during mammary development, we analyzed genome- wide changes in Twist1 binding between two hTERT-immortalized human breast cell lines. We identified 2,538 sites bound by Twist1. \nDocument-2: Genome-wide identification and characterization of yeast transcription factors that interact with SPT15 \nPrevious reports have suggested that yeast SPT15 acts background of at least 276 genes, which are putatively controlled in two phased bursts of persists for several cell generations outnumbered those activated by both genes that are deregulated similar way and by different modules throughout log-phase growth. \nJASPAR has released 4 major versions of their database, with the most recent being the largest. The new release contains 457 non-redundant, curated profiles. This includes the first batch of profiles derived from ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip whole-genome binding experiments, and 177 yeast TF binding profiles. The introduction of a yeast division brings the convenience of JASPAR to an active research community. As binding models are refined by newer data, the JASPAR database now uses versioning of matrices: in this release, 12% of the older models were updated to improved versions. Classification of TF families has been improved by adopting a new DNA-binding domain nomenclature. A curated catalog of mammalian TFs is provided, extending the use of the JASPAR profiles to additional TFs belonging to the same structural family. The changes in the database set the system ready for more rapid acquisition of new high-throughput data sources. Additionally, three new special collections provide matrix profile data produced by recent alternative high-throughput approaches."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: The transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins are a class of proteins embedded in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The cellular location and functional diversity of TMB proteins makes them an important protein class. The prediction of TMB protein structures is a challenging problem due to the difficulty in crystallizing transmembrane proteins. A novel method using pairwise interstrand residue statistical potentials derived from globular (non-outer membrane) proteins is introduced to predict the supersecondary structure of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. The algorithm transFold employs a generalized hidden Markov model (i.e., multitape S-attribute grammar) to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures and then computes by dynamic programming the minimum free energy beta-barrel structure. Hence, the approach can be viewed as a \"wrapping\" component that may capture folding processes with an initiation stage followed by progressive interaction of the sequence with the already-formed motifs. This approach differs significantly from others, which use traditional machine learning to solve this problem, because it does not require a training phase on known TMB structures and is the first to explicitly capture and predict long-range interactions. TransFold outperforms previous programs for predicting TMBs on smaller (<or=200 residues) proteins and matches their performance for straightforward recognition of longer proteins. An exception is for multimeric porins where the algorithm does perform well when an important functional motif in loops is initially identified.\nThe computational tools for the prediction of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins are algorithms that use a combination of machine learning and statistical potentials to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. These tools are designed to overcome the difficulty in crystallizing transmembrane proteins, which has hindered the understanding of their structure and function."

Both enzymes trim peptides to the required length for loading on MHC class I molecules, but they have distinct substrate specificities. Whereas ERAP2 is responsible for the trimming of a broad range of epitopes, ERAP1 prefers peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal residues.\nThe dimerization of ERAP1 and ERAP2 promotes the trimming of epitope precursor peptides. Physical interaction with ERAP2 changes basic enzymatic parameters of ERAP1 and improves its substrate-binding affinity. As a result, the dimerization of ERAP1 and ERAP2 creates complexes that are more efficient in trimming peptides. These complexes are likely to enhance Ag presentation by cells displaying coordinated expression of the two enzymes."

Prostaglandin E2, released from oxygenated arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase enzymes, may be one of the mediators through which an increased cholelithogenic risk is produced by fish oil ingestion in cholesterol-fed human subjects and experimental animals. Document-1: It has been suggested that gallstones are formed largely as a result of the precipitation of cholesterol in supersaturated bile. The addition of a saturated squalene solution to cholesterol-saturated solution of human or bovine serum albumin decreases cholesterol solubility and leads to precipitation of cholesterol crystals that appear to be typical gallstone cholesterol. It is less clear how cholesterol becomes supersaturated in the biliary tract, but there is some evidence that an associated phospholipid may play an important role. The question of how biliary cholesterol can become supersaturated with respect to cholesterol has been addressed in several ways. One study examined the release of cholesterol from small gallbladder epithelial cells. It was proposed that cholesterol is not released directly from these cells into bile, but is first taken up into endocytic vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing their contents into the biliary tree. \nAccording to the two documents, R-spondin 1 and noggin play an important role in non-damaged gallbladders by regulating the release of stored mucus glycoproteins. Prostaglandin E2, released from oxygenated arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase enzymes, acts as an agent for the release of these glycoproteins. This release of mucus glycoproteins into the biliary tree helps to prevent the formation of gallstones by keeping cholesterol supersaturated."

Proteins exist in different three-dimensional shapes, or conformations, which affect their function. Proteins are constantly being produced, degraded and recycled in a process called protein turnover. Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions. Proteomics is a relatively new field that builds on the techniques and concepts of genomics, the study of an organism’s entire genome. Proteomics is used to identify and quantify all the proteins produced by a cell, tissue or organism. Proteomics can be used to study the changes that occur in proteins during normal development or in response to a particular stimulus, such as a drug. No, the proteome of mice hippocampus has not been analysed."

Despite advances in surgical techniques and chemotherapy, the available treatments are still rather limited. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a possible treatment option for NSCLC, and it is now being tested in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether overexpression of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G (LY6G), is associated with better prognosis in NSCLC patients. We analyzed the expression of LY6G in tumor tissue from patients with NSCLC who had undergone surgery. We found that patients with LY6G-positive tumors had a significantly better prognosis than those with LY6G-negative tumors. Our findings suggest that overexpression of LY6G is associated with better prognosis in NSCLC patients and that LY6G may be a potential target for immunotherapy.\nDocument-0:\nThe selective PLK1 inhibitor BI 6727 significantly induced the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SCLC cell lines. FACS analysis showed an increase in the population of cells in the G2/M phase, followed by DNA damage and the consequent activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)/ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-Chk1/Chk2 checkpoint pathway. In addition, BI 6727 treatment resulted in clearly attenuated growth and apoptosis in NCI-H446 xenografts. The level of histone H2AX phosphorylation at serine-139 (鉎2AX) was markedly increased both in vitro and in vivo.

Identification of early biomarkers of gastric tumorigenesis is indispensable for conquering this devastating disease. Although a number of molecular factors are associated with gastric cancer, the precise mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. The present report describes a study that was performed in rats to examine the changes in mRNA expression of NHERF1 and TFF2 in response to the oral administration of a carcinogen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). NHERF1 and TFF2 encode membrane-associated proteins that play important roles in the development and progression of gastric carcinoma. The results of this study showed that administration of MNNG to rats induced a significant increase in the mRNA expression of both NHERF1 and TFF2 in the rat stomach. These results suggest that administration of MNNG to rats leads to the upregulation of NHERF1 and TFF2 mRNAs in the stomach, which might be involved in the development and progression of gastric carcinoma.\nBoth T-UCR UCH-L1 and T-UCR NHERF1 have been implicated in gastric cancer."

They have an aromatic ring structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring (Figure 1). The three principal aromatic amino acids are phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. These amino acids are essential nutrients and must be present in the diet. \nThe shikimate pathway is the only pathway that can synthesize these aromatic amino acids de novo. The shikimate pathway also synthesizes a wide variety of secondary metabolites that play important roles in plant defense, such as phenolic compounds and lignin (Figure 1). \nThe shikimate pathway is found in all plants, algae, and bacteria, but not in animals. In bacteria, the pathway is used to synthesize all of the aromatic amino acids. In plants, the pathway is used to synthesize phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, as well as many secondary metabolites.\nThe shikimate pathway has seven enzymatic steps (Figure 2). The first step is the condensation of erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate to form 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptonate-7-phosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme erythrose-4-phosphate synthase. The second step is the conversion of 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptonate-7-phosphate to chorismate by the enzyme chorismate synthase. Chorismate is then converted to prephenate by the enzyme prephenate dehydrogenase. In the fourth step, prephenate is converted to phenylpyruvate by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.

    "text-davinci-002_response": "ADAMTS18 is a gene that is frequently methylated in tumors, and its expression is often silenced or downregulated in breast cancer cells. It has been shown to suppress cell migration and invasion, as well as to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, ADAMTS18 deregulates AKT and NF-闎 signaling, and its methylation could be a potential tumor biomarker for breast cancer."

This is based on the fact that the anticonvulsant activity possessed by these substituted 4-thiazolidones was unrelated to their ability to inhibit selectively the NAD-dependent oxidations by rat brain homogenates, and that all thiazolidones potentiated pentobarbital (sodium) sleeping time in mice when administered in a dose of 100 mg/kg."
