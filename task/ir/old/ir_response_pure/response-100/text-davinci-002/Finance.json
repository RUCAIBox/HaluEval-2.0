For stock market investments, the tax on long-term capital gains is zero.

Perhaps the most significant advantage is that investors are not restricted to the types of investments that are typically offered by banks and brokerage firms. This affords investors a greater degree of flexibility when it comes to choosing investments. Additionally, self-directed IRAs may also have lower fees than traditional IRAs. Another advantage of a self-directed IRA is that investors are not required to take distributions at age 70½ like they are with traditional IRAs.\nThere are a few disadvantages to consider as well. One is that self-directed IRAs require a level of diligence and experience that may be beyond the average investor. Additionally, there is the potential for fraud with self-directed IRAs, so investors need to be extra careful when choosing a custodian and making investments."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Some companies will buy a number of their own shares back periodically (usually quarterly) at varying prices, usually depending what they think their shares are currently under- or over-valued at.  Others will conduct what are usually referred to as \"Dutch auctions\" in which they fix a certain \"floor price,\" below which they will not go, and shareholders submit sealed bids to the company for as many or as few shares as they wish to sell at that price; the company then decides how many shares it will accept at that price and notifies the shareholders with the winning bids.  Self-tender offers are yet another possibility, in which the company decides on the amount of money it will spend on the program, the number of shares it will accept (or \"repurchase target\"), and again, the price, and then invites shareholders to submit tenders (bids) to sell their shares.  The shareholder (or group of shareholders) with the fewest number of shares, but at the submitted price or higher, is usually the one who sells their shares to the company.  In a Dutch auction, any shareholder is free not to participate, and if the shareholder does not wish to sell their shares to the company, they simply do nothing.  In a self-tender offer, a shareholder must decide in advance whether or not he or she wishes to sell his or her shares to the company.  There may be slight variations on all of the above, but these are the three most common methods used.\nThe main pro of a share consolidation is that it leaves the price of the stock unchanged. The main con is that it is a very public and obvious sign of distress for a company to cut its dividend."

Come up with general estimates of what you currently bring in and spend each month overall. Just ballpark it.\nNext, figure what you currently spend towards housing in particular. Whether you are paying for it or your landlord is paying for it, someone pays for a lot of different things for housing. For now, my list would include (1) Rent, (2) Mortgage Payment, (3) Electricity, (4) Gas, (5) Sewer, (6) Water, (7) Trash, (8) Other utilities...

If your landlord pays it right now, leave it out as that's included in your rent payment. Obviously each cell won't be filled in. Fill in the rest of the third column.

You probably have a good estimate of any electricity bills, etc that you currently pay, but those may be slightly higher in a house vs. a condo or an apartment. As for things like sewer, water, trash or other 'community' utilities, my bet would be that your landlord pays for those. If you need a good estimate ask around with some co-workers or friends that own their own places. They would also be a good resource for property insurance estimates... shooting from the hip I would say about $100/month based on this website.\nAdd up the third column and see how that monthly expense amount on housing compares against your current monthly budget.

    "text-davinci-002_response": "401(k) plans have employer matching contributions, which are a percentage of an employee's salary that the employer adds to the employee's 401(k) account. Employers typically require employees to spread their 401(k) contributions throughout the year to get the maximum match. There are two main reasons for this requirement. First, it creates incentive for the employee to contribute more and increases the funds under management of the 401(k) plan. The size of the plan influences the fees that are charged in each of the funds offered. (The more assets under management, the better for those in the plan.) More importantly, 401(k) plans are not allowed to discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. That discrimination is determined by calculating the average deferrals by your lower compensated employees and comparing them to the average deferrals of your highly compensated employees. If highly compensated employees are saving too much compared to the rest of the pack, they will have some of their contributions returned the next year (with all the tax implications of that). Forcing everyone to contribute 6% to get the full match helps the plan to not fail the discrimination test and protects the highly compensated employees from losing some of their tax deferrals."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: A derivative is a type of security whose price is dependent upon or derived from one or more underlying assets. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties based upon the asset or assets. It is essentially a bet on how the underlying asset’s price will move in the future. For example, a stock option is a derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price by a certain date. The price of an option is determined by the underlying stock’s price at the time the option is exercised. The terminology stems from the fact that the value of the derivative is “derived” from the value of the underlying asset. \nA financial investor would bother to buy a derivative and then hedge the position because it is a way to make money while minimizing risk. Derivatives can be used to hedge against changes in the price of the underlying asset, which can protect the investor from losses. For example, if an investor buys a stock for $100 and then buys a put option on that stock with a strike price of $90, the investor is protected from any price decline below $90. If the stock price falls to $80, the investor can exercise the option and sell the stock for $90, realizing a $10 profit. If the stock price had risen to $110, the investor could simply sell the stock and pocket the $10 profit. In this way, derivatives can help investors make money while limiting their downside risk."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "The reason why having less institutional investors in stocks is considered a good thing is because these investors often times have rules that they must abide by, which can end up hurting the stock price. For example, some institutional investors will not hold on to stock below $5, which can really Affect major banking stocks, some of which end up doing reverse stock splits to keep their share price high. Additionally, when a stock is removed from an index, big investors leave quickly and the share price suffers. Therefore, it is generally better for a stock to have a mix of both retail and institutional investors."

For children aged six through 17, a new benefit of up to $60 per year will be introduced. The enhanced UCCB will provide over $3 billion in additional support to roughly 3.8 million Canadian families each year.  Starting in July 2016, the government will also introduce the Canada Child Benefit (CCB), which will replace the UCCB and the Canada child tax benefit as well as the National child benefit supplement. The CCB will provide a maximum annual benefit of $6,400 per child under the age of six and $5,400 per child aged six through 17. To help ensure that the new benefit gets into the hands of those who need it most, the CCB will be income-tested and all families that are eligible for the National child benefit supplement will automatically qualify for the new CCB.\nFamilies with children under the age of 18 will receive up to $355 more each month as a result of the new measures.\nDocument-2: The changes to the UCCB are part of the Government's commitment to help Canadian families with the high costs of raising their children.

For example, a study by Dalbar found that the average investor underperformed the S&P 500 by 3.66% per year between 1992 and 2015.

I'm sorry I can't give you a definitive answer on the taxes, but you really need to ask a tax accountant.    \nDocument-1:\nThe tax implications of earnings from the stock market can be significant. If you are a day trader, for example, your gains may be considered short-term capital gains and subject to a higher tax rate than long-term capital gains. Moreover, if you are considered to be in the business of trading securities, your gains may be taxed as ordinary income at your marginal tax rate.\nFor most investors, however, the tax implications of stock market earnings are not as significant. Long-term capital gains on stocks held for more than a year are taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary income. Thus, if you are a buy-and-hold investor, you may be able to minimize your tax liability by holding your stocks for at least one year before selling.\nThe bottom line is that you should consult with a tax professional to determine the best way to structure your stock market investments for maximum tax efficiency."

This divisor is derived from the original divisor of 0.19849 (which was based on the number of stocks in the index when it was first created in 1896) and has been adjusted over time to account for stock splits and other changes in the index.\nCritics of the current system argue that ignoring dividends gives a false impression of the true performance of the DJIA, as it does not take into account the payments that shareholders receive from companies in the index. Proponents of the current system argue that dividends are not relevant to the performance of the index, as they are not directly related to the price of the stock.\nThe debate over how to account for dividends is likely to continue for some time, and there is no clear consensus on the best way to do so.

A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price. In the US, when you place a trade with any broker, you can either place a limit order or a market order. A market order just fills your order with the next best sellers in line. If you place an order for 100 shares, the sellers willing to sell 100 shares at the lowest price will be matched with your order (sometimes you may get 50 shares at one price and 50 shares at a slightly different price). If your stock has a lot of volatility and you place a market order for a small amount of shares, you will get the best price. If you place a limit order, you specify the price at which you want to buy shares. Your order will then only be filled with sellers willing to sell at that price or lower (i.e. they must be at least as good as you specified). This means you could place an order at a limit that does not get filled (the stock could move in a direction away from your limit price).

However, depending on the tax jurisdiction, there may be some special cases where the dividends are not taxable, such as if the company is a tax-exempt organization or if the dividends are reinvested in additional shares.\nFrom document 0, we can see that the tax implications of dividends vary depending on the country's tax laws and the investor's personal tax situation. In general, dividends are treated as income and are thus taxable. However, as document 1 mentions, there are some cases where dividends may be exempt from taxation."

The money from the sale of shares is used to finance growth and development activities within the company. Public companies often issue new shares when they need to raise money quickly, and the sale of shares is a relatively easy way to do this. The key to issuing new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders is to use the money raised from the sale of new shares to finance activities that will increase the value of the company. If the company uses the money raised from the sale of new shares to finance activities that increase the value of the company, then the existing shareholders will not be diluted."
