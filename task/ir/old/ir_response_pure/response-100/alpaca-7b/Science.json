This is because zero-dimensional materials, such as molecules, do not have any length and thus cannot generate an electromagnetic field. This is in contrast to materials with more than one dimension, which can generate an electromagnetic field due to their length. Therefore, zero-dimensional biomaterials lack inductive properties."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim is accurate. According to the document, Rett syndrome (RTT) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder of females that occurs once in 10,000–15,000 births. Affected females develop normally for 6–18 months, but then lose voluntary movements, including speech and hand skills. Most RTT patients are heterozygous for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 (refs. 3–12), encoding a protein that binds to methylated sites in genomic DNA and facilitates gene silencing. Previous work with Mecp2-null embryonic stem cells indicated that MeCP2 is essential for mouse embryogenesis. Here we generate mice lacking Mecp2 using Cre-loxP technology. Both Mecp2-null mice and mice in which Mecp2 was deleted in brain showed severe neurological symptoms at approximately six weeks of age. Compensation for absence of MeCP2 in other tissues by MeCP1 (refs. 19,20) was not apparent in genetic or biochemical tests. After several months, heterozygous female mice also showed behavioral symptoms. The overlapping delay before symptom onset in humans and mice, despite their profoundly different rates of development, raises the possibility that stability of brain function, not brain development per se, is compromised by the absence of MeCP2. This supports the accuracy of the claim."

This is supported by Document-0, which provides evidence that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) interacts with the tumor suppressor p53. To characterize the putative interaction, the authors mapped the binding of the core domain of p53 (p53c) to an array of immobilized HIF-1alpha-derived peptides and found two peptide-sequence motifs that bound to p53c with micromolar affinity in solution. One sequence was adjacent to and the other coincided with the two proline residues of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (P402 and P564) that act as switches for the oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF-1alpha. The binding affinity was independent of the hydroxylation state of P564. NMR spectroscopy revealed that these sequence motifs bind to the DNA-binding site of p53c. Because the two sequences are homologous and separated by 120 residues, and one is in a largely unstructured transactivation domain, the authors speculate that each sequence motif in HIF-1alpha binds to a different subunit of the p53 tetramer, leading to very tight binding. The binding data supports the proposal that p53 provides a route for the degradation in hypoxic tumor cells of HIF-1alpha that is not hydroxylated at the two proline residues."

Between January and June 1998, two pharmacists observed consecutive drug administration rounds by nurses on two wards in a U.K. hospital and recorded all MAEs identified. The observers intervened in cases of potentially harmful errors. MAE records were audited to determine the percentage of omitted doses for which a corresponding reason was documented for the observation periods and for nonobservation periods. Error rates for each drug administration round were analyzed according to whether they were for the nurse's first, second, third (and so on) observed round. Error rates were calculated before and after the first intervention with nurses for whom an intervention was made. Observer reliability was calculated by comparing the rates of errors identified by the two observers. There was no difference between the observation and nonobservation periods in the percentage of omitted doses for which a reason was documented, and there was no change in the error rate with repeated observations. There was no difference in error rates before and after the first intervention for each nurse. There was also no difference in error detection between the two observers and no change with increasing duration of observation. Observation of nurses during drug administration at a U.K. hospital did not significantly affect the MAE rate; nor did tactful interventions by the observers. Observer reliability was high. Concerns about the validity and reliability of observational methods for identifying MAEs may be unfounded."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that certain immunomodulator-human dialyzable leukocyte extract (hDLE) peptides are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic cells is supported by scientific evidence. Endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) play an important role in the termination of the inflammatory response following infection and tissue injury. Recent findings indicate that stress can impair the anti-inflammatory capacities of these hormones. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated splenocytes of mice that were repeatedly subjected to social disruption (SDR) stress were less sensitive to the immunosuppressive effects of corticosterone (CORT) as demonstrated by an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced cell survival. Myeloid cells expressing the marker CD11b were shown to play a key role in this process. Here we investigated the role of the bone marrow as a potential source of the GC-insensitive cells. The study revealed that LPS-stimulated bone marrow cells, in the absence of experimental stress, were virtually GC-resistant and retained high levels of cell viability after treatment with CORT. Recurrent exposure to the acute stressor over a period of 2, 4 or 6 days led to an increase in the GC sensitivity of the bone marrow cells. This increase in GC sensitivity was associated with enhanced mRNA expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an increase in the number of myeloid progenitors, and a decrease in the proportion of mature CD11b+ cells. The changes in the cellular composition of the bone marrow were accompanied by an increase in splenic CD11b+ cell numbers. Simultaneous assessment of the GC sensitivity in bone marrow and spleen revealed a significant negative correlation between both tissues suggesting that social stress causes the redistribution of GC-insensitive myeloid cells from the bone marrow to the spleen."

Here we show that CBFbeta is also required at very early stages of natural killer (NK)-cell development. We also demonstrate that T-cell development aborts during specification, as the expression of Gata3 and Tcf7, which encode key regulators of T lineage specification, is substantially reduced, as are functional thymic progenitors. Constitutively active Notch or IL-7 signaling cannot restore T-cell expansion or differentiation of CBFbeta insufficient cells, nor can overexpression of Runx1 or CBFbeta overcome a lack of Notch signaling. Therefore, the ability of the prethymic cell to respond appropriately to Notch is dependent on CBFbeta, and both signals converge to activate the T-cell developmental program."

We showed recently that NOX2 activity in mouse dendritic cells (DCs) prevents acidification of phagosomes, promoting antigen cross-presentation. In order to investigate the role of NOX2 in the regulation of the phagosomal pH in human DCs, we analyzed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phagosomal/endosomal pH in monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages (M(diameter)s) from healthy donors or patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). As expected, we found that human M(diameter)s acidify their phagosomes more efficiently than human DCs. Accordingly, the expression of the vacuolar proton ATPase (V-H(+)-ATPase) was higher in M(diameter)s than in DCs. Phagosomal ROS production, however, was also higher in M(diameter)s than in DCs, due to higher levels of gp91phox expression and recruitment to phagosomes. In contrast, in the absence of active NOX2, the phagosomal and endosomal pH decreased. Both in the presence of a NOX2 inhibitor and in DCs derived from patients with CGD, the cross-presentation of 2 model tumor antigens was impaired. We conclude that NOX2 activity participates in the regulation of the phagosomal and endosomal pH in human DCs, and is required for efficient antigen cross-presentation."

Direct reprogramming strategies enable rapid conversion of somatic cells to cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocyte-like cells without going through the pluripotent state. \n3. A recently described protocol couples Yamanaka factor induction with pluripotency inhibition followed by BMP4 treatment to achieve rapid reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to beating cardiomyocyte-like cells. \n4. The original study was performed using Matrigel-coated tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), a stiff material that also non-specifically adsorbs serum proteins. \n5. Protein adsorption-resistant poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) materials can be covalently modified to present precise concentrations of adhesion proteins or peptides without the unintended effects of non-specifically adsorbed proteins. \n6. We first reproduced the Efe et al. protocol on Matrigel-coated TCPS (the original material), reprogramming adult mouse tail-tip mouse fibroblasts (TTF) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to cardiomyocyte-like cells that demonstrated striated sarcomeric α-actinin staining, spontaneous calcium transients, and visible beating. \n7. We then designed poly(ethylene glycol) culture substrates to promote MEF adhesion via laminin and RGD-binding integrins. PEG hydrogels improved proliferation and reprogramming efficiency (evidenced by beating patch number and area, gene expression, and flow cytometry), yielding almost twice the number of sarcomeric α-actinin positive cardiomyocyte-like cells as the originally described substrate. \n8.

The document states that studying the metabolism of immune cells in recent years has emphasized the tight link existing between the metabolic state and the phenotype of these cells. It also mentions that Macrophages in particular are a good example of this phenomenon, and that whether the macrophage obtains its energy through glycolysis or through oxidative metabolism can give rise to different phenotypes. It further mentions that metabolic intermediates are not just a source of energy but can be directly implicated in a particular macrophage phenotype. In M1 macrophages, the Krebs cycle intermediate succinate regulates HIF1α, which is responsible for driving the sustained production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β. In M2 macrophages, the sedoheptulose kinase carbohydrate kinase-like protein is critical for regulating the pentose phosphate pathway.

The research used functionalized biomaterials incorporating various combinations of an inflammatory cytokine, immune danger signal, and tumor lysates to control the activation and localization of host DC populations in situ. The results indicated that a critical pattern of DC subsets correlates with the evolution of therapeutic antitumor responses and provides a template for future vaccine design.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that Klf2 is important for proper myeloid cell function is accurate. Recent findings indicate that stress can impair the anti-inflammatory capacities of endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) by making myeloid cells less sensitive to the immunosuppressive effects of corticosterone (CORT). This is demonstrated by an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced cell survival in LPS-stimulated splenocytes of mice that were repeatedly subjected to social disruption (SDR) stress. Myeloid cells expressing the marker CD11b were shown to play a key role in this process. Here we investigated the role of the bone marrow as a potential source of the GC-insensitive cells. The study revealed that LPS-stimulated bone marrow cells, in the absence of experimental stress, were virtually GC-resistant and retained high levels of cell viability after treatment with CORT. Recurrent exposure to the acute stressor over a period of 2, 4 or 6 days led to an increase in the GC sensitivity of the bone marrow cells. This increase in GC sensitivity was associated with enhanced mRNA expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an increase in the number of myeloid progenitors, and a decrease in the proportion of mature CD11b+ cells. The changes in the cellular composition of the bone marrow were accompanied by an increase in splenic CD11b+ cell numbers. Simultaneous assessment of the GC sensitivity in bone marrow and spleen revealed a significant negative correlation between both tissues suggesting that social stress causes the redistribution of GC-insensitive myeloid cells from the bone marrow to the spleen. This suggests that social stress can impair the anti-inflammatory capacities of endogenous GCs. Therefore, Klf2 is important for proper myeloid cell function."

Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB or inhibition of cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts, and thus the endogenous levels of PDGF-BB, increases CD31hiEmcnhi vessel number and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice.\n8.

Document-0 provides evidence that Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10/TIEG1) is an important regulator of T regulatory cell suppressor function and CD4+CD25- T cell activation through distinct mechanisms involving transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and Foxp3. KLF10 overexpressing CD4+CD25- T cells induced both TGF-beta1 and Foxp3 expression, an effect associated with reduced T-Bet (Th1 marker) and Gata3 (Th2 marker) mRNA expression. Consistently, KLF10-/- CD4+CD25- T cells have enhanced differentiation along both Th1 and Th2 pathways and elaborate higher levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Furthermore, KLF10-/- T regs have reduced suppressor function, independent of Foxp3 expression, with decreased expression and elaboration of TGF-beta1. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that in response to TGF-beta1, KLF10 can transactivate both TGF-beta1 and Foxp3 promoters, implicating KLF10 in a positive feedback loop that may promote cell-intrinsic control of T cell activation. Finally, KLF10-/- CD4+CD25- T cells promoted atherosclerosis by approximately 2-fold in ApoE-/-/scid/scid mice with increased leukocyte accumulation and peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, KLF10 is a critical regulator in the transcriptional network controlling TGF-beta1 in both CD4+CD25- T cells and T regs and plays an important role in regulating atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yes, mouse models can be generated using \"artificial spermatids\". This is based on the fact that mouse spermatozoa obtained 5 min after release from the excised caudae epididymides showed a characteristic fluorescence pattern in the presence of the fluorophore chlortetracycline (CTC). There was uniform fluorescence over the entire head with about half the sperm population showing a brighter line of fluorescence across the equatorial segment; this fluorescence pattern was designated \"F\". After 90-min incubation in culture medium (CM) containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, most of the sperm heads showed a dark band of nonfluorescence over the equatorial and postequatorial segment, while the anterior portion of the head showed bright fluorescence. This fluorescence pattern was designated \"B\". The time course for the disappearance of pattern F matched the time course of the appearance of pattern B, with a half-time of 30 min. The transformation was complete in 90 min. At longer times of incubation in CM, the percentage of spermatozoa showing pattern B declined; fluorescence over the entire head was lost, characteristic of the pattern for acrosome-reacted sperm (P. M. Saling and B. T. Storey (1979). J. Cell Biol. 83, 544-555). \nMouse sperm showing pattern B were able to undergo the acrosome reaction, either spontaneously or by induction with acid-solubilized zonae pellucidae from mouse eggs (H.M. Florman and B. T. Storey (1982). Dev. Biol. 91, 121-130). The latter reaction was blocked by its specific inhibitor 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). \nMouse sperm showing pattern F could not be induced to undergo the acrosome reaction by exposure to solubilized zonae. This implies that the change from fluorescence pattern F to fluorescence pattern B corresponds with changes in the sperm which make them susceptible to undergo the"

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The assertion that \"Neutrophils produce IL-1β in response to large particles\" is supported by scientific evidence. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a cytokine produced in the normal brain that acts on its specific receptor IL-15Rα and co-receptors IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ in neuronal cells. The functions of the cerebral IL-15 system, however, are not yet clear. To test the hypothesis that IL-15Rα regulates metabolic activity and body temperature, researchers quantified the specific metabolic phenotype of IL-15Rα knockout mice. These normal-appearing mice were leaner with lower fat composition. During the entire circadian cycle, the knockout mice had a significantly higher acrophase in locomotor activity and heat dissipation. During the light phase, there was significantly greater food intake, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production. The difference in the dark and light phases suggests that IL-15Rα participates in circadian rhythm regulation. The higher oxygen consumption in the light phase indicates adaptive thermogenesis in the knockout mice. The body temperature of the receptor knockout mice was significantly higher than the control in the light phase, and this was mainly caused by a large difference occurring between 0600 and 0900 h. In addition to the metabolic chamber studies and circadian rhythm analyses, qPCR of hypothalamic homogenates indicated higher mRNA expression of orexin and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 cation channels. Consistent with a direct role of IL-15Rα in the hypothalamus, IL-15 treatment of the wild-type mice induced c-Fos expression in the preoptic area. We conclude that activation of hypothalamic neurons by IL-15 in mice contributes to thermoregulation and modifies the metabolic phenotype."

Here, we show that CNTF signals through the CNTFRα–IL-6R–gp130β receptor complex to increase fatty-acid oxidation and reduce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), independent of signaling through the brain. Thus, our findings further show that the antiobesogenic effects of CNTF in the periphery result from direct effects on skeletal muscle, and that these peripheral effects are not suppressed by diet-induced or genetic models of obesity, an essential requirement for the therapeutic treatment of obesity-related diseases."

According to Document-0, somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA). They are most frequently observed in two hotspots: the helical domain (E545K and E542K) and the kinase domain (H1047R). Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro, their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors have recently been initiated, and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific, genetically defined malignancies. In this study, we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R. Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan-PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in clinical development, led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination. In contrast, mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235. However, when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, ARRY-142886, there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers.

Germfree IL-10(-/-) mice on either a mixed (C57BL/6 x 129/Ola) or inbred (129/SvEv) genetic background were monoassociated with H. hepaticus ATCC 51448 by oral feeding and rectal enemas. In a second experiment, germfree IL-10(-/-) mice were colonized with stool from SPF mice that harbored or did not harbor endogenous H. hepaticus. After 7 to 9 weeks of colonization, weight loss and mortality were assessed, the colon was isolated for histology and IL-12 secretion, and mesenteric lymph node cells were assessed for T-cell activation markers. It was found that IL-10(-/-) mice monoassociated with H. hepaticus for up to 16 weeks showed almost no histologic colitis or increased IL-12 production. SPF IL-10-knockout mice had no significant difference in weight loss, mortality rate, histologic scores, colonic IL-12 secretion, or T-cell activation with or without H. hepaticus.

In a study of 31 human tumors, the levels and distribution of hypoxia were evaluated using fluorescent immunohistochemical detection of binding by the 2-nitroimidazole, EF5. The results showed that hypoxia was a heterogeneous property of human tumors, and that necrosis was usually found adjacent to the highest level of binding in an individual patient's tumor. However, hypoxia often occurred without necrosis. In the group of tumors studied, the most common relationship between blood vessels (PECAM/CD31) and EF5 staining was consistent with diffusion-limited hypoxia; acute hypoxia occurred infrequently. Within a given patient's tumor, there was an inverse correlation between regions of proliferation (Ki-67) and regions of hypoxia. Again, however, when these parameters were examined in a group of patients, the absence of proliferation did not predict the presence of hypoxia. The relationships between hypoxia and other biologic endpoints are complex, but, within a given tumor's spatial relationships, they are in accord with known physiologic principles. Thus, our data emphasize that the relationships between hypoxia and other biologic parameters vary between patients. Necrosis, proliferation, and blood vessel distribution cannot predict the level or presence of hypoxia in an individual patient's tumor."

When univalents are connected by chiasmata or by an artificial tether, this erroneous attachment is converted to monopolar attachment and stabilized. \n6.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim is accurate. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) proliferate rapidly and divide symmetrically producing equivalent progeny cells. In contrast, lineage committed cells acquire an extended symmetrical cell cycle. Self-renewal of tissue-specific stem cells is sustained by asymmetric cell division where one progeny cell remains a progenitor while the partner progeny cell exits the cell cycle and differentiates. There are three principal contexts for considering the operation and regulation of the pluripotent cell cycle: temporal, regulatory, and structural. The primary temporal context that the pluripotent self-renewal cell cycle of hESCs is a short G1 period without reducing periods of time allocated to S phase, G2, and mitosis. The rules that govern proliferation in hESCs remain to be comprehensively established. However, several lines of evidence suggest a key role for the naïve transcriptome of hESCs, which is competent to stringently regulate the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle. This supports the requirements of pluripotent cells to self-propagate while suppressing expression of genes that confer lineage commitment and/or tissue specificity. However, for the first time, we consider unique dimensions to the architectural organization and assembly of regulatory machinery for gene expression in nuclear microenviornments that define parameters of pluripotency. From both fundamental biological and clinical perspectives, understanding control of the abbreviated ESC cycle can provide options to coordinate control of proliferation versus differentiation. Wound healing, tissue engineering, and cell-based therapy to mitigate developmental aberrations illustrate applications that benefit from knowledge of the biology of the pluripotent cell cycle."

It also demonstrates that pathologically almost 80% of all lung cancer cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been found to exist in a large number of NSCLCs. CAFs have been proven to promote tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy through paracrine effects in most solid tumors. \nIn addition, the document shows that firstly, we isolated CAFs from patient tissues and demonstrated that they promoted cell proliferation and chemoresistance to cisplatin in the lung cancer cell lines A549 and 95D in a paracrine manner. Secondly, using ELISA and quantative PCR, we found that a higher amount of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) existed in the CAFs rather than that observed in the normal fibroblasts (NFs). Thirdly, we detected that SDF-1 facilitated lung cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance via the CXCR4-mediated signaling pathway which involved NF-κB and Bcl-xL. Moreover, we also confirmed that the expression level of SDF-1 in the CAFs was negatively regulated by microRNA mir-1 through microRNA overexpression and quantitative PCR. \nOverall, our data provide one explanation for the effects of CAFs on lung cancer cells. Meanwhile, our results also suggest CAFs as a potential therapeutic target in tumor treatment. This evidence supports the assertion that G-CSF prevents MDSCs from infiltrating tumors."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The assertion that \"Mice are incapable of producing neutralizing antibodies in reponse to the Eilat virus (EILV) produced in mosquitos\" is not valid. This is because, as documented in Document-0, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) episomes are stably maintained in permissive proliferating cell lines due to EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) protein-mediated replication and segregation. Previous studies showed the ability of EBV episomes to confer long-term transgene expression and correct genetic defects in deficient cells. To achieve quantitative delivery of EBV episomes in vitro and in vivo, we developed a binary helper-dependent adenovirus (HDA)-EBV hybrid system that consists of one HDA vector for the expression of Cre recombinase and a second HDA vector that contains all of the sequences for the EBV episome flanked by loxP sites. Upon coinfection of cells, Cre expressed from the first vector recombined loxP sites on the second vector. The resulting circular EBV episomes expressed a transgene and contained the EBV-derived family of repeats, an EBNA-1 expression cassette, and 19 kb of human DNA that functions as a replication origin in mammalian cells. This HDA-EBV hybrid system transformed 40% of cultured cells. Transgene expression in proliferating cells was observed for over 20 weeks under conditions that selected for the expression of the transgene. In the absence of selection, EBV episomes were lost at a rate of 8 to 10% per cell division. Successful delivery of EBV episomes in vivo was demonstrated in the liver of transgenic mice expressing Cre from the albumin promoter. This novel gene transfer system has the potential to confer long-term episomal transgene expression and therefore to correct genetic defects with reduced vector-related toxicity and without insertional mutagenesis."

According to the documents, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the activity and safety of combined use of BioResponse DIM® (BR-DIM) with tamoxifen. Women prescribed tamoxifen (n = 130) were randomly assigned oral BR-DIM at 150 mg twice daily or placebo, for 12 months. The primary study endpoint was change in urinary 2/16α-hydroxyestrone (2/16α-OHE1) ratio. Changes in 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE1), serum estrogens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), breast density, and tamoxifen metabolites were assessed. Ninety-eight women (51 placebo, 47 DIM) completed intervention; compliance with treatment was >91%. BR-DIM increased the 2/16α-OHE1 ratio (+3.2 [0.8, 8.4]) compared to placebo (−0.7 [−1.7, 0.8], P < 0.001). Serum SHBG increased with BR-DIM compared to placebo (+25 ± 22 and +1.1 ± 19 nmol/L, respectively). No change in breast density measured by mammography or by MRI was observed. Plasma tamoxifen metabolites (endoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen) were reduced in women receiving BR-DIM versus placebo (P < 0.001). Minimal adverse events were reported and did not differ by treatment arm. In patients taking tamoxifen for breast cancer, daily BR-DIM promoted favorable changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating levels of SHBG. Further research is warranted to determine whether BR-DIM associated decreases in tamoxifen metabolites, including effects on endoxifen levels, attenuates the clinical benefit of tamoxifen.

The document provides evidence that CENP-A chromatin forms the foundation for kinetochore assembly, which is regulated by the chaperone HJURP(Scm3) and Mis18 in vertebrates and fission yeast. The recruitment of Mis18 and HJURP(Scm3) to centromeres is cell cycle regulated. Mis18 associates with Mis18BP1(KNL2), which is critical for the recruitment of Mis18 and HJURP(Scm3). We identify two novel fission yeast Mis18-interacting proteins (Eic1 and Eic2), components of the Mis18 complex. Eic1 is essential to maintain Cnp1(CENP-A) at centromeres and is crucial for kinetochore integrity; Eic2 is dispensable. Eic1 also associates with Fta7(CENP-Q/Okp1), Cnl2(Nkp2) and Mal2(CENP-O/Mcm21), components of the constitutive CCAN/Mis6/Ctf19 complex. No Mis18BP1(KNL2) orthologue has been identified in fission yeast, consequently it remains unknown how the key Cnp1(CENP-A) loading factor Mis18 is recruited. Our findings suggest that Eic1 serves a function analogous to that of Mis18BP1(KNL2), thus representing the functional counterpart of Mis18BP1(KNL2) in fission yeast that connects with a module within the CCAN/Mis6/Ctf19 complex to allow the temporally regulated recruitment of the Mis18/Scm3(HJURP) Cnp1(CENP-A) loading factors. The novel interactions identified between CENP-A loading factors and the CCAN/Mis6/Ctf19 complex are likely to also contribute to CENP-A maintenance in other organisms."

The document states that human placental lactogen and unconjugated estriol concentrations in maternal serum were evaluated in 100 uneventful twin pregnancies and compared with those observed in 16 twin pregnancies associated with intrauterine growth retardation or single intrauterine fetal death. In pregnancies associated with intrauterine growth retardation, human placental lactogen levels were at the lower limit of normal range for singleton pregnancies, whereas estriol levels were normal in most cases. When one of the fetuses had died before week 33 of pregnancy, both human placental lactogen and estriol levels were low and were almost at the levels in singleton pregnancy. When intrauterine fetal death occurred after week 36 of pregnancy, both hormone levels remained normal until term. Thus, human placental lactogen is a better indicator of intrauterine growth retardation in twin pregnancy than estriol. Both human placental lactogen and estriol are useful for the monitoring of the surviving fetus in the case of single intrauterine fetal death."

Between January and June 1998, two pharmacists observed consecutive drug administration rounds by nurses on two wards in a U.K. hospital and recorded all MAEs identified. The observers intervened in cases of potentially harmful errors. MAE records were audited to determine the percentage of omitted doses for which a corresponding reason was documented for the observation periods and for nonobservation periods. Error rates for each drug administration round were analyzed according to whether they were for the nurse's first, second, third (and so on) observed round. Error rates were calculated before and after the first intervention with nurses for whom an intervention was made. Observer reliability was calculated by comparing the rates of errors identified by the two observers. There was no difference between the observation and nonobservation periods in the percentage of omitted doses for which a reason was documented, and there was no change in the error rate with repeated observations. There was no difference in error rates before and after the first intervention for each nurse. There was also no difference in error detection between the two observers and no change with increasing duration of observation. Observation of nurses during drug administration at a U.K. hospital did not significantly affect the MAE rate; nor did tactful interventions by the observers. Observer reliability was high.

METHODS Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 12 adult patients with simple migraine (without aura and without depressive/anxious disorder) (S-M group), 12 adult patients with complicated migraine (without aura but complicated with depressive/anxious disorder) (Co-M group), and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (Control group). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient were measured at genu, body, and splenium of the CC, respectively. RESULTS There were significant differences in FA values at all locations of the CC among the 3 groups. The FA values from both the SM and Co-M groups were significantly lower than the control (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). The FA values from Co-M group were significantly lower than the SM group (P < .01). The apparent diffusion coefficient values of the above regions had no significant differences among these groups (P > .05). There were negative correlations between FA value of genu of the CC and disease course as well as FA value of genu and body of the CC and headache frequency (P < .05). Negative correlations were also found between FA values at all locations of the CC and Hamilton anxiety and Hamilton depression scores (both P < .05). CONCLUSIONS There might be an integrity change of neurofibrotic microstructures existing as a possible neuroanatomical basis in the CC of migraine patients complicated with depressive/anxious disorder."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The assertion that IRG1 has antiviral effects against neurotropic viruses is valid, as demonstrated by the fact that imaging the expression of successful gene transduction has been demonstrated in vivo for the first time by using an appropriate combination of \"marker gene\" and \"marker substrate\" in an experimental animal model. The herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene was selected as an example of a marker gene, and the recombinant STK retrovirus containing HSV1-tk was used to transduce RG2 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. RG2TK+ cell lines expressing the HSV1-tk gene and three potential marker substrates for the HSV1-TK enzyme were evaluated. Radiolabeled 5-iodo-2'-fluoro-2'deoxy-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FIAU) was shown to be a substantially better marker substrate for the HSV1-TK enzyme than 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine or ganciclovir. The magnitude of FIAU accumulation in different RG2TK+ clones corresponded to their sensitivity to ganciclovir and to the level of HSV1-tk mRNA expression. Imaging the expression of HSV1-tk in transduced RG2 tumor cells was demonstrated in animals using quantitative autoradiography; 2-[14C]FIAU accumulation was shown to be high in RG2TK+ brain tumors growing in one hemisphere and very low in nontransduced RG2 tumors in the contralateral hemisphere. Transduction of RG2 tumor cells with the HSV-tk gene in vivo resulted in tumors which accumulated FIAU to high levels and produced clearly defined images. Given the level of FIAU accumulation in the transduced tumors, it is likely that a clinically applicable method for imaging HSV1-tk gene expression can be implemented using existing clinical imaging techniques."

This is supported by the evidence presented in Document-0, which shows that a region between -1000 and 1400 (called URS1) is necessary for transcription in addition to a \"TATA\"-like region at -90. This region is necessary for correct cell cycle control, but not for a/alpha repression or mother/daughter control. This suggests that whole chromosome aneuploidy is rare in domesticated populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "1. Infectious pathogens can selectively stimulate activation or suppression of T cells to facilitate their survival within humans. \n2. In this study we demonstrate that the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni has evolved with two distinct mechanisms to suppress T cell activation. \n3. During the initial 4- to 12-wk acute stages of a worm infection both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are anergized. \n4. In contrast, infection with male and female worms induced T cell anergy at 4 wk, which was replaced after egg laying by T cell suppression via a known NO-dependent mechanism, that was detected for up to 40 wk after infection. \n5. Worm-induced anergy was mediated by splenic F4/80+ macrophages (Mphi) via an IL-4-, IL-13-, IL-10-, TGF-beta-, and NO-independent, but cell contact-dependent, mechanism. \n6. F4/80+ Mphi isolated from worm-infected mice were shown to induce anergy of naive T cells in vitro. \n7. Naive Mphi exposed to live worms in vitro also induced anergy in naive T cells. \n8. Flow cytometry on in vivo and in vitro worm-modulated Mphi revealed that of the family of B7 costimulatory molecules, only programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was selectively up-regulated. \n9. The addition of inhibitory mAb against PD-L1, but not PD-L2, to worm-modulated Mphi completely blocked the ability of these cells to anergize T cells. \n10. These data highlight a novel mechanism through which S. mansoni worms have usurped the natural function of PD-L1 to reduce T cell activation during early acute stages of infection before the subsequent emergence of egg-induced T cell suppression in the chronic stages of infection."

Here, we report that deletion of miR-302a-d in mice results in a fully penetrant late embryonic lethal phenotype. Knockout embryos have an anterior neural tube closure defect associated with a thickened neuroepithelium. The neuroepithelium shows increased progenitor proliferation, decreased cell death, and precocious neuronal differentiation. mRNA profiling at multiple time points during neurulation uncovers a complex pattern of changing targets over time. Overexpression of one of these targets, Fgf15, in the neuroepithelium of the chick embryo induces precocious neuronal differentiation. Compound mutants between mir-302 and the related mir-290 locus have a synthetic lethal phenotype prior to neurulation. Our results show that mir-302 helps regulate neurulation by suppressing neural progenitor expansion and precocious differentiation. Furthermore, these results uncover redundant roles for mir-290 and mir-302 early in development."

Document-0: We describe a case of severe neonatal anemia with kernicterus caused by compound heterozygosity for null mutations in KLF1, each inherited from asymptomatic parents. One of the mutations is novel. This is the first described case of a KLF1-null human. The phenotype of severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and marked erythroblastosis is more severe than that present in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type IV as a result of dominant mutations in the second zinc-finger of KLF1. There was a very high level of HbF expression into childhood (>70%), consistent with a key role for KLF1 in human hemoglobin switching. We performed RNA-seq on circulating erythroblasts and found that human KLF1 acts like mouse Klf1 to coordinate expression of many genes required to build a red cell including those encoding globins, cytoskeletal components, AHSP, heme synthesis enzymes, cell-cycle regulators, and blood group antigens. We identify novel KLF1 target genes including KIF23 and KIF11 which are required for proper cytokinesis. We also identify new roles for KLF1 in autophagy, global transcriptional control, and RNA splicing. We suggest loss of KLF1 should be considered in otherwise unexplained cases of severe neonatal NSHA or hydrops fetalis."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that \"Synaptic activity enhances local release of brain derived neurotrophic factor from postsynaptic dendrites\" is supported by the document. The document states that Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family, which is activated by neuronal activators p35 or p39. Cdk5 regulates a variety of neuronal activities including migration, synaptic activity and neuronal death. p35 and p39 impart cytoplasmic membrane association of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5, respectively, through their myristoylation, but it is not clearly understood how the cellular localization is related to different functions. We investigated the role of Cdk5 activity in the subcellular localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5. Cdk5 activity affected the localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5 through phosphorylation of p35 or p39. Using unphosphorylated or phosphomimetic mutants of p35 and p39, we found that phosphorylation at Ser8, common to p35 and p39, by Cdk5 regulated the cytoplasmic localization and perinuclear accumulation of unphosphorylated S8A mutants, and whole cytoplasmic distribution of phosphomimetic S8E mutants. Cdk5 activity was necessary to retain Cdk5-activator complexes in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, small but distinct amounts of p35 and p39 were detected in the nucleus. In particular, nuclear p35 and p39 were increased when the Cdk5 activity was inhibited. p39 had a greater propensity to accumulate in the nucleus than p35, and phosphorylation at Thr84, specific to p39, regulated the potential nuclear localization activity of the Lys cluster in p39. These results suggest that the subcellular localization of the Cdk5-activator complexes is determined by its kinase activity, and also implicate a role for p39-Cdk5 in the nucleus."

Additionally, the ligation of TCR/CD3 on CD4 or CD8 T cells led to CD3 nanoscale co-clustering or interaction with CD4 or CD8 co-receptors forming 200-500 nm nano-domains or >500 nm micro-domains. Such nano-spatial co-clustering of CD3 and CD4 or CD3 and CD8 appeared to be an intrinsic event of TCR/CD3 ligation, not purely limited to MHC engagement, and be driven by Lck phosphorylation.
