On the other hand, an Equity loan is money borrowed from the bank to buy assets such as houses, shares, etc. Equity loans can be in the form of a lump sum upfront or as a line of credit with fixed interest rates, while Protected-equity loans are specifically used for shares and have a protective mechanism in place to prevent further losses.",
