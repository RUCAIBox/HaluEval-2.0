The SH3 domain of Hof1 binding to a proline-rich motif in Cyk3 is a typical mode of interaction between proteins with these domains and motifs. The timing of the interaction during cytokinesis is also consistent with the roles of these proteins. The statement that the interaction is crucial for proper coordination but not for normal localization suggests a specific functional role that does not affect protein localization. Lastly, the ability of yeast cells to tolerate certain defects but not the combination of defects in the actomyosin ring and septum formation is in line with the redundancy and robustness often observed in biological systems.
