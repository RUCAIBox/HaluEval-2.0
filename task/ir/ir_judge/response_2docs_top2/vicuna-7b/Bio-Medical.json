Both syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that play a role in growth and development, and they are characterized by overgrowth of certain body parts, such as the head and limbs, as well as intellectual disability. However, there are some key differences between the two syndromes. For example, Weaver syndrome is caused by mutations in the WNT7B gene, while Sotos syndrome is caused by mutations in the NSD1 gene. Additionally, while Weaver syndrome is characterized by a specific set of physical features, such as a broad forehead and a flat face, Sotos syndrome is characterized by a more general set of physical features, such as a round face and a stocky build.",
