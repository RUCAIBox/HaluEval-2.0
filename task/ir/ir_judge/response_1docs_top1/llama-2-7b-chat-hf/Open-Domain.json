In other words, it selects the last element of a particular type that is not followed by any other elements of the same type.\nIn the context of the information provided, the user is asking how to resolve an issue where the Last Child class is not working as expected. The user has discovered that the Last Child class is selecting the last element of a particular type within its parent element, but it is also selecting the element that comes after the last element of that type.
