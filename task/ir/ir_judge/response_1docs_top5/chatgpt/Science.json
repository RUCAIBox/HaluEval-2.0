It acts as a selective autophagy receptor, binding to and targeting ubiquitinated cargo for degradation within autophagosomes.\n2. Studies have shown that an increase in p62 levels can lead to defective autophagy, as it may lead to the accumulation of p62-containing aggregates and impaired turnover of ubiquitinated proteins.\n3. Prostate tumor stroma refers to the supportive tissue surrounding the prostate tumor. Research has indicated that changes in the tumor microenvironment, including alterations in stromal cells, can impact tumor progression and response to therapy.\n4. Studies have specifically linked the increase of p62 in prostate tumor stroma with defective autophagy, suggesting that this dysregulation of autophagy may contribute to prostate tumor progression and resistance to treatment.\nOverall, based on these factual points, the statement that an increase of p62 in prostate tumor stroma results in defective autophagy is well-supported by scientific evidence.",

Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of glucose in the blood, often leading to symptoms such as confusion and cognitive impairment.

There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that hypoglycemia could decrease the risk of dementia.

Additionally, the concept of a 'charge zipper mechanism' is a known phenomenon in molecular biology, where interactions between oppositely charged amino acid residues can stabilize protein-protein interactions.\nTherefore, it is plausible that the arm density of TatAd complexes could be due to structural rearrangements, possibly involving a 'charge zipper mechanism'.
