    "chatgpt_judge_raw": "1. TRUE\n2. FALSE [correction]: A TV with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio that is the same height as an average 50'' TV would not be approximately 118 inches wide. To correct this statement, we would need the actual height of the 50'' TV to calculate the width with the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. If we assume the 50'' TV has a 16:9 aspect ratio and 'TV size' refers to the diagonal measurement, we can calculate the height as follows:\n\nLet's assume the width (W) and height (H) of the 16:9 aspect ratio TV are in the ratio of 16:9. Given that the diagonal (D) is 50 inches, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: \nW^2 + H^2 = D^2.\n\nW/H = 16/9, so W = (16/9) * H.\n\nPlugging this into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\n(16/9 * H)^2 + H^2 = 50^2,\n256/81 * H^2 + 81/81 * H^2 = 50^2,\n337/81 * H^2 = 50^2,\nH^2 = 81/337 * 50^2,\nH ≈ (9/√337) * 50,\nH ≈ 24.5 inches (approximately).\n\nNow, to find the width according to a 2.35:1 aspect ratio using this height:\n\nWidth = Aspect Ratio * Height,\nWidth = 2.35 * 24.5,\nWidth ≈ 57.575 inches (approximately).\n\nSo, a TV with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio that is the same height as an average 50'' TV would be approximately 57.575 inches wide, not 118 inches.",
