There are additional limitations for passive activities, such as rental real estate, where losses are generally only deductible up to the amount of passive income unless specific exceptions apply. Passive activity loss limitations are governed by IRS rules pertaining to passive activities.",

For the Canadian economy, a high dollar can make exports more expensive, leading to a decrease in demand for Canadian goods and services in international markets. This can negatively impact businesses and potentially lead to job losses. On the other hand, a high dollar can make imports cheaper, benefiting consumers but potentially harming domestic industries.\nFor investors, a high dollar can lead to lower returns on investments in international markets, as the value of the dollar increases relative to other currencies. This may lead investors to shift their investments to domestic markets or seek out alternative strategies to hedge against currency fluctuations.\nFor consumers, a high dollar can lead to cheaper prices for imported goods, which can benefit household budgets. However, it can also lead to higher prices for domestically produced goods and services, especially those that rely on exports or imported raw materials.\nOverall, the effect of a high dollar on the Canadian economy, investors, and consumers is complex and can have both positive and negative consequences depending on the specific circumstances and sectors involved.",

The requirement for verification usually depends on the individual's tax situation and the source of funds, among other criteria.

This involves the company buying back its own shares from existing shareholders at a negotiated price, often causing market activity to increase the share price marginally. This allows the company to return value to its shareholders while issuing new shares. Additionally, the company can negotiate a price with a mutual fund or founder for a large block of shares. If the company gets close to purchasing all outstanding shares, it would essentially be the same as the management taking the company private. To prevent a single holdout from keeping the very last share at a high price, the board of directors usually has the authority to bind minority shareholders to buyout or merger decisions. An example of a company taking this approach is when Michael Dell took Dell Computer private in 2013 by raising external money to offer a fair price to the board, which accepted it, allowing him to take the company private.",
