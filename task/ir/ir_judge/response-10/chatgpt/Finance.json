    "chatgpt_response": "A public company can issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders by offering buy options for the required number of shares at a below-market price. These options are given for free to the current shareholders proportional to their current holding. If everybody exercises their options, they get new cheap shares that compensate for the loss of share value. If they don't have the capital themselves, they can sell the options and get compensation that way instead. This allows the company to raise capital without diluting the value held by existing shareholders.",

The options to purchase new shares are provided to current shareholders for free, in proportion to their holdings.\n3. If existing shareholders exercise their options, they receive new shares at a lower cost, which compensates for any potential loss in share value.\n4.
