Additionally, the molecular diversity of Dscam transcripts generated through a mechanism of alternative splicing is highly conserved across major insect orders, suggesting an unsuspected molecular complexity of the innate immune system of insects.

TRUE: Inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex using CK-666 can lead to slowing of centripetal (inward) flow of actin filaments, as the Arp2/3 complex is involved in generating the pushing force that drives actin polymerization and network formation.\n\n3. TRUE: Pretreatment with CK-666 can indeed cause cells to change from a lamellipodial (flat, sheet-like projections) dominated shape to a filopodial (long, finger-like projections) one, as the inhibition of Arp2/3 complex affects the balance between different types of actin architecture.\n\n4.
