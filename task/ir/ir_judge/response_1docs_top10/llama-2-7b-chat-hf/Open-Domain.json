The document suggests that Mia started by keeping her song simple and building on it, which is an excellent way to accelerate the songwriting process and work out the structure of the song. Additionally, the document mentions that many complex songs from 5 or 6-piece bands started life as a few chords strummed on an acoustic guitar, which suggests that Mia may have started by writing simple songs on an acoustic guitar before expanding on them. Therefore, it is likely that Mia has joined the profession of songwriting.",
