    "chatgpt_response": "The mechanism of viroid replication involves the transcription of the viroid RNA by cellular RNA polymerase II, followed by the processing of the viroid RNA by cellular enzymes to generate unit-length circular RNA strands. These circular RNA strands then serve as templates for the replication of new viroid RNA molecules. In the case of Avsunviroidae viroids, the multimeric replicative intermediates of either polarity generated in plastids self-cleave through hammerhead ribozymes to facilitate replication."

The study identifies GRHL2 as a gene strongly correlated with CDH1 in cancer cell lines and differentially expressed in cell lines overexpressing EMT-inducing transcription factors ZEB1, SNAIL, and TWIST. High GRHL2 expression is also highly correlated with worse relapse-free survival in all four subtypes of breast cancer. Additionally, the integration of GRHL2 into a mathematical model of EMT regulation validates its role in promoting EMT. Therefore, it can be concluded that GRHL2 over-expression does lead to EMT in breast cancer."
