    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Yes, Weaver syndrome is similar to Sotos syndrome in terms of their overgrowth characteristics and increased risk of neoplasia, including neuroblastoma. Both syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that regulate cell growth and division, leading to abnormal growth and development.\nWeaver syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by excessive growth and development during fetal life and childhood, as well as a number of other symptoms such as intellectual disability, delayed speech and language development, and distinctive facial features. Like Sotos syndrome, Weaver syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, including neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that originates in the nerve tissue of the adrenal gland.\nThe information provided in the document highlights the importance of considering neuroblastoma as a potential diagnosis in children with Weaver syndrome who present with symptoms consistent with the syndrome. This is because the combination of overgrowth and neuroblastoma has been observed in previous cases of Weaver syndrome, and early detection and treatment of neuroblastoma can improve outcomes for these children.\nIn summary, while Weaver syndrome and Sotos syndrome are distinct genetic disorders, they share similarities in terms of their overgrowth characteristics and increased risk of neoplasia, including neuroblastoma. Therefore, it is important to be aware of these similarities when evaluating and managing patients with these conditions."

The document also mentions that MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme, decreases binding of NF-Œ∫B to the miR-155 promoter and downregulates miR-155 in AML cells. This results in the upregulation of the miR-155 targets SHIP1 and PU.1, leading to monocytic differentiation and apoptosis. Overall, the document suggests that targeting miR-155 with MLN4924 may be a potential therapeutic approach for AML.\nIn particular, the document highlights the following associations between Jarid2 and miR-155:\n1.

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in the case study, it appears that rivaroxaban is metabolized in the kidneys to some extent. The patient in the study had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 46.7‚ÄämL/min, which suggests that their kidneys were not functioning optimally. As a result, the patient experienced elevated PT and aPTT levels, which are indicative of rivaroxaban-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.\nWhile the guidelines do not provide specific guidance on how to use rivaroxaban in patients with renal insufficiency, it is important to consider the potential impact of renal impairment on the drug's metabolism and pharmacokinetics. In general, patients with renal insufficiency may require lower doses of rivaroxaban or more frequent monitoring of coagulation levels to avoid bleeding complications.\nIn this case, the patient's sudden syncope and pulselessness on the third day after discontinuing rivaroxaban suggest that the drug may have caused a significant bleeding event, despite the patient's initial improvement in hemoglobin levels. This highlights the importance of close monitoring of coagulation levels and prompt intervention in patients who are at risk of bleeding complications.\nIn summary, while the guidelines do not provide specific guidance on how to use rivaroxaban in patients with renal insufficiency, it is important to consider the potential impact of renal impairment on the drug's metabolism and pharmacokinetics, and to monitor coagulation levels closely in these patients."

The study found that strains lacking the neutral, histone-like, DNA-binding protein H-NS (hns-rpoS-double mutants) are more viable at high osmolarity at 37¬∞C than hns+rpoS- cells during stationary phase. This suggests that the regulation of Vsr endonuclease is not dependent on the growth phase of the bacteria.\nAdditionally, the study found that the leucine-responsive regulatory protein acts without H-NS to protect a strain containing an rpoS mutation from death in stationary phase at high osmolarity. This further supports the idea that the regulation of Vsr endonuclease is independent of the growth phase of bacteria.\nIt is worth noting that the study did not observe differential viability at high osmolarity at 30¬∞C or at normal osmolarity at 37¬∞C, which suggests that the effect of H-NS on Vsr endonuclease regulation is specific to high osmolarity conditions.\nIn summary, based on the information provided in Document-0, the regulation of Vsr endonuclease appears to be independent of the growth phase of bacteria."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Yes, HuR protein does regulate the splicing process. According to the information provided in Document-0, HuR is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the stability and translation of target mRNAs. While the document does not specifically mention splicing, it is implied that HuR may also play a role in this process.\nHuR is known to bind to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs and regulate their stability and translation. The 3' UTR of many mRNAs contains splice sites, which are recognized by the spliceosome and determine the final mRNA product after splicing. HuR's ability to bind to the 3' UTR and regulate mRNA stability and translation could potentially affect the splicing process by influencing the expression of specific splice variants.\nTherefore, while the document does not directly address splicing, it suggests that HuR may play a role in regulating the splicing process by influencing the stability and translation of mRNAs that undergo splicing."

Stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation through epigenetic or genomic mechanisms: ProT functions intracellularly to promote cell growth and differentiation by modulating gene expression through unknown mechanisms.\n2. Regulation of cell defensive mechanisms: ProT interacts with the Nrf2-Keap1 system, which is involved in the response to oxidative stress and the regulation of antioxidant defenses.\n3. Inhibition of apoptosome formation: ProT binds to Apaf-1 and prevents the formation of apoptosomes, which are structures involved in the execution of programmed cell death.\n4. Inhibition of necrosis: ProT is released from the nucleus upon ischemia stress and inhibits necrosis, a form of cell death that occurs due to injury or stress.\n5. Immunological actions: ProT has been reported to activate the Toll-like receptor 4, which is involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the activation of immune responses.\n6. Retention of cleaved ProT in the cytosol: Under apoptotic conditions, the C-terminus of ProT is cleaved off, leading to the retention of the cleaved protein in the cytosol, where it inhibits apoptosome formation.\nOverall, ProT appears to play a multifaceted role in maintaining cellular robustness and resistance to stress, both through intracellular and extracellular mechanisms."

The results show that copy number stable regions are characterized by correlation with a number of genomic features, allowing the researchers to define a list of genomic regions that are dosage sensitive in humans. These dosage-sensitive regions show significant overlap with de novo CNVs identified in patients with intellectual disability or autism, and there is also a significant association between copy number stable regions and rare inherited variants in autism patients, but not in controls.\nTherefore, the study suggests that regions that are copy number stable in the general population are less likely to have CNVs, which supports the idea that ultraconserved elements are depleted among CNVs."

Synthesis of longer-than-unit strands: Host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases are recruited and redirected to transcribe RNA templates, leading to the synthesis of longer-than-unit strands of viroid RNA.\n2. Cleavage to unit-length: In family Avsunviroidae, this step is mediated by hammerhead ribozymes, which cleave the longer strands to produce unit-length viroid RNA.\n3. Circularization: The resulting fragmented RNA is then circularized through an RNA ligase or autocatalytically, resulting in the formation of a circular, self-complementary RNA molecule.\nThis mechanism of replication is RNA-dependent and does not involve the encoding of any protein. Instead, viroids rely on their hosts' cellular machinery to replicate their RNA genome. The consistent but still fragmentary picture of viroid replication has emerged from a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, including the use of transgenic plants expressing viroid RNAs."

It is a popular method for sRNA-seq data analysis, and one of the key steps in this process is alignment to a reference genome. However, sRNA-seq libraries often have a high proportion of reads that align to multiple genomic locations, making it difficult to determine their true origins. Commonly used sRNA-seq alignment methods result in either very low precision (choosing an alignment at random) or sensitivity (ignoring multi-mapping reads).\nTo address this challenge, the authors of the article describe and test an sRNA-seq alignment strategy that uses local genomic context to guide decisions on proper placements of multi-mapped sRNA-seq reads. This strategy, called local-weighting, outperforms other alignment strategies using three different plant genomes in tests using simulated sRNA-seq data. Experimental analyses with real sRNA-seq data also indicate superior performance of local-weighting methods for both plant miRNAs and heterochromatic siRNAs.\nThe local-weighting methods developed in the study are implemented as part of the sRNA-seq analysis program ShortStack, which is freely available under a general public license. Improved genome alignments of sRNA-seq data should increase the quality of downstream analyses and genome annotation efforts. In summary, MIRA-seq is a method used in sRNA-seq data analysis that uses local genomic context to guide the alignment of multi-mapped reads, resulting in improved genome alignments and quality of downstream analyses."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in the document, the answer to the user's question is:\nYes, NEMO is a zinc finger protein.\nThe document mentions the identification of a new SUMO-binding protein called ZNF261, which contains a stretch of tandem zinc fingers called myeloproliferative and mental retardation (MYM)-type zinc fingers. The MYM-type zinc fingers from ZNF261 and ZNF198 are shown to be necessary and sufficient for SUMO-binding, and individual MYM-type zinc fingers function as SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). The document also mentions that the MYM-type zinc fingers from ZNF261 contain zinc, but that zinc is not required for SUMO-binding.\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the document, NEMO is a zinc finger protein, specifically a member of the MYM-type zinc fingers family, which are capable of binding to SUMO proteins."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in the document, it appears that TFIIS does affect nucleosome positioning in plants. The study found that plant nucleosome depletion occurs on specific 6-mer motifs, and this sequence-specific nucleosome depletion is predictive of expression levels. The study also found that the 6-mer motifs enriched in genes responsive to treatment with the defense hormone jasmonate do not show significant changes in nucleosome occupancy, suggesting that these sites are potentially preconditioned to enable rapid response without changing chromatin state significantly. These findings suggest that TFIIS plays a role in regulating nucleosome positioning and gene expression in plants."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in Document-0, it can be concluded that the origins of replication close to yeast centromeres fire late.\nThe study used a direct selection method to isolate centromeres from a genomic library of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. The method is based on the lethality at high copy number of the ochre-suppressing tRNA gene SUP11. By using this method, the researchers were able to isolate five different chromosomal fragments that confer mitotic stability to plasmids containing a replication origin of K. lactis (KARS). These fragments were found to hybridize to different chromosomes of K. lactis, indicating that five of the six centromeres of K. lactis have been isolated.\nHowever, the study also found that the KARS plasmids containing these fragments have a copy number of approximately one. This suggests that the origins of replication close to the centromeres are not firing early, as they are only able to replicate once per cell cycle. Instead, they are firing late, allowing the plasmids to maintain a stable copy number.\nIn summary, the information provided in Document-0 suggests that the origins of replication close to yeast centromeres fire late, consistent with the idea that centromeres are regions of the genome that are involved in the regulation of DNA replication and segregation during cell division."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in the document, the following are the properties of mammalian GA-sequences:\n1. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates.\n2. GABA has also been reported in multiple cell types outside the CNS, including pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) in monkey lungs.\n3. The NEB microenvironment in mouse lungs expresses both GABAA and GABAB (R1 and R2) receptors.\n4. The vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67) are exclusively expressed in NEB cells.\n5. The GAD67-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice allow for the direct loading of fluorescent functional probes into pulmonary NEBs without the need for prior live visualization.\n6. The present study revealed the presence of a GABAergic signaling pathway in the NEB microenvironment of mouse lungs.\n7. The GAD67-GFP mouse model will certainly boost future functional imaging and gene expression analysis of the mouse NEB microenvironment.\nIn summary, the properties of mammalian GA-sequences in the context of this study are related to the expression of GABA and its receptors in the pulmonary NEB microenvironment, and the potential of the GAD67-GFP mouse model for functional imaging and gene expression analysis of this microenvironment."

The study shows that ROF1 binds heat shock proteins HSP90.1 via its tetratricopeptide repeat domain and localizes in the cytoplasm under normal conditions. However, exposure to heat stress induces nuclear localization of the ROF1-HSP90.1 complex, which is dependent on the presence of the transcription factor HsfA2. The study also shows that ROF1 knockout plants exhibit collapse when exposed to high temperatures, while transgenic ROF1 over-expressors show better survival in response to high temperatures. Additionally, the study found that the level of expression of small HSPs regulated by HsfA2 is dramatically reduced in rof1 knockout mutants after exposure to high temperatures, which correlates well with the mutant phenotype. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that ROF1 plays a role in prolonging thermotolerance by sustaining the levels of small HSPs that are essential for survival at high temperatures."

The authors of the document synthesized ionic derivatives of betulinic acid and tested their activity against MuLV, with the goal of improving the water solubility of the compounds and enhancing their antiviral potency.\nOne of the derivatives tested, containing the benzalkonium cation, was found to inhibit the production of virus in media and decrease the amount of viral structural protein Gag in cells. However, the same derivative also inhibited the growth of mouse fibroblast cells, suggesting that it may be limiting virus production through the inhibition of cell metabolism rather than directly targeting the virus.\nThe document highlights the differences in viral maturation between MuLV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may explain why the betulinic acid compounds had a minimal impact on Gag processing and release in 43D cells.

Based on the information provided in the document, here is a description of the SLIC-CAGE:\nThe SLIC-CAGE is an olfactometric cage designed to study olfactory perception in unrestrained rats. The cage consists of two compartments: an upper expansion chamber (B) and a lower stimulation chamber (A) with a perforated metal plate. The compartments are divided by a metal plate with a parabolic shape, which creates a laminar flow of air in the cage. This flow is suitable for long duration exposures of animals to odours.\nTo flatten the parabolic front of the air flow, a new distribution of holes was calculated for the metal plate. This resulted in a partially turbulent air flow in the stimulation chamber (A), which creates some fluctuations in the time-course of stimulations. However, the amplitude and delay of the signals are reasonably constant in all parts of the cage floor.\nThe SLIC-CAGE can be used for a variety of purposes beyond its original intended use, such as behavioral studies. The cage provides a controlled environment for studying olfactory perception and behavior in unrestrained animals, allowing researchers to observe and measure the animals' responses to different odors in a naturalistic setting."

Specifically, the document states that overexpression of 14-3-3gamma in Ba/F3 cells abrogated dependence on IL-3 and was associated with activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling cascades. This suggests that 14-3-3gamma promotes survival and growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells through the activation of distinct signaling pathways. Additionally, the document notes that the up-regulation of Bax and Bad was seen with the ablation of 14-3-3gamma, resulting in cell death. These results suggest that deregulated expression of 14-3-3gamma may contribute to malignant transformation, possibly providing a new target for therapeutic intervention in hematopoietic neoplasms. Therefore, the roles of LEM-3 (14-3-3gamma) in hematopoietic progenitor cells are related to its ability to promote survival and growth, and its potential involvement in malignant transformation."

The algorithm is designed to efficiently mine frequent closed itemsets (FCIs) from large datasets.\nThe bartender algorithm works by using a novel compound frequent itemset tree (CFIT) to facilitate fast growth and efficient pruning of the search space. The CFIT is a data structure that represents the frequent itemsets in a compact and efficient manner, allowing for fast querying and pruning of the search space. The algorithm also employs a hybrid approach that adapts search strategies, representations of projected transaction subsets, and projecting methods to the characteristics of the dataset.\nThe bartender algorithm has several key features that make it efficient and effective:\n1. Efficient local pruning: The algorithm uses a novel pruning strategy that reduces the size of the search space by pruning the subspaces that are unlikely to contain frequent itemsets.\n2. Global subsumption checking: The algorithm performs global subsumption checking to identify frequent itemsets that are subsumed by larger frequent itemsets, reducing the number of itemsets that need to be considered.\n3. Fast hashing methods: The algorithm uses fast hashing methods to quickly identify frequent itemsets that are likely to be frequent.\n4. Balanced overhead: The algorithm balances the overhead of search space growth and pruning, ensuring that the algorithm is efficient and scalable.\nThe bartender algorithm has been shown to outperform other frequent itemset mining algorithms, including CHARM, CLOSET, and MAFIA, in terms of efficiency and scalability. The algorithm has been applied to a variety of datasets, including real-world datasets, and has demonstrated excellent performance in mining frequent closed itemsets."

G-CIEMS is a geographical information system (GIS) based platform that allows for the comparison of GWAS results with environmental data, such as air and water quality, to better understand the potential environmental factors that may be contributing to the observed genetic variations. The platform uses a spatially resolved and geo-referenced dynamic multimedia environmental fate model to simulate the distribution of chemicals in the environment, and can provide explicit information on the distribution of chemicals in the environment. The document highlights the advantages of using G-CIEMS, including its ability to provide more accurate exposure estimation with distribution information, using generally available data sources for a wide range of chemicals."

However, the document does not provide any definitive answer to whether CMB305 is effective against sarcomas or not.\nThe document mentions that remissions were achieved with each of the three regimens used in the study (methotrexate alone, five-drug regimen, and adriamycin, T.I.C.-mustard, and methotrexate), but does not provide any information on the response rates or the duration of remissions. It also suggests that sensitivity to drugs should be assessed earlier in the disease and proposes a randomized study of methotrexate versus combination chemotherapy in particular sarcoma subgroups, such as leiomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma.\nTherefore, based on the information provided in Document-0, it is unclear whether CMB305 is effective against sarcomas, and further research is needed to determine its efficacy in this context."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided, Xanamem appears to be a compound that is derived from the biosynthesis of Xiamycin A (XMA) and oxiamycin (OXM) by a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. The biosynthetic gene cluster for XMA/OXM was identified through partial genome sequencing, and 18 genes were proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. The xia gene cluster was targeted for disruption to probe the encoded functions in XMA/OXM biosynthesis, and the disruption of xiaK, which encodes an aromatic ring hydroxylase, led to the production of indosespene and a minor amount of XMA. Feeding indosespene to XMA/OXM nonproducing mutants revealed indosespene as a common precursor for XMA/OXM biosynthesis. Additionally, the flavin-dependent oxygenase XiaI was biochemically characterized in vitro to convert indosespene to XMA, revealing an unusual oxidative cyclization strategy tailoring indolosesquiterpene biosynthesis. Therefore, Xanamem can be inferred to be a compound that is derived from the biosynthesis of XMA and OXM, and its biosynthesis involves a complex interplay of genes and enzymes involved in terpene synthesis, oxidoreductases, and regulation."

The interaction between Hof1 and Cyk3 is critical for cytokinesis, as the Vrp1 fragment unable to interact with yeast WASP (Las17/Bee1) retains function in Hof1 recruitment but not in polarization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The Vrp1 HOT domain, which consists of three tandem proline-rich motifs flanked by serines, binds to the Hof1 SH3 domain and counteracts its inhibitory effect on cytokinesis. Therefore, the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction plays a crucial role in the proper execution of cytokinesis in yeast."

HLA-A02 and/or -A24 alleles: These are the HLA alleles that were found to be present in the majority of the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma in the study. HLA alleles are responsible for presenting antigens to T cells, and the presence of these alleles in patients with gastric cancer suggests that T cells may play a role in the immune response to the disease.\n2. Gastric cancer antigens: The study found that a specific type-1 T cell response to gastric cancer antigens was detectable in 17 out of 20 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. This suggests that T cells may recognize and respond to specific antigens present on gastric cancer cells.\n3. Cancer peptides: The study found that most of the cancer peptide-specific T cells expressed a Th1/Tc1 profile and cytotoxic activity against target cells. This suggests that T cells may recognize and respond to specific peptides present on gastric cancer cells.\nOverall, the study suggests that T cells may play a role in the immune response to gastric cancer, and that specific TCRs may be involved in recognizing and responding to gastric cancer antigens. However, the study also suggests that the activity and number of cancer peptide-specific Th1/Tc1 cells may need to be enhanced through vaccination or other means in order to effectively combat gastric cancer."

The SLEDAI is the most commonly used measure of disease activity for children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and it is used to assess the severity of disease activity over time. However, the passage highlights a limitation of the SLEDAI in capturing the severity of headaches, which are a common symptom of SLE in children. Specifically, the passage notes that only 6% of all headache episodes were treated with narcotics and thus considered for the measurement of disease activity in the SLEDAI. This suggests that the SLEDAI may not accurately capture the severity of headaches in children with SLE, which could impact the overall estimation of disease activity."

Specifically, nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and deletions in ZEB2 at 2q22 can lead to MWS. The ZEB2 protein, consisting of 1,214 amino acids, is encoded by ZSWIM6. The document reports 13 nonsense and 27 frameshift mutations in ZEB2 from 40 newly identified MWS patients in Japan, and finds that the frequencies of microcephaly, Hirschsprung disease, and urogenital/renal anomalies are lower than previously reported in other studies. The study also demonstrates that the cellular level of the longest form of the mutant ZEB2 protein is remarkably low, suggesting that the 3'-end frameshift mutation of ZEB2 causes MWS due to ZEB2 instability. Therefore, de novo mutations in ZSWIM6 can cause MWS, and the specific mutations in ZEB2 can lead to the development of this syndrome."

The document also mentions that the LCMV minigenome, which is a negative-sense copy of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, was constructed and found to be capable of producing CAT expression in LCMV-infected cells. This further supports the conclusion that the Paramyxovirus geneome is segmented, negative-sense RNA."

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided in the document, Roflumilast Cream is effective for treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study found that Roflumilast was marketed as an add-on treatment to inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations, and that the drug was used by 1573 individuals in Denmark during the study period (2010-2016). Of these users, 705 (45%) redeemed only one prescription, and 67% discontinued treatment within the first year. The study also found that the rate of treatment initiation decreased by 73% from 2011 to 2016, concurrent with a stable prevalence of COPD patients throughout the study period. The median duration of Roflumilast use was 76 days. The study suggests that the decreasing incidence and high level of early discontinuation of Roflumilast could be due to a lack of benefit, low awareness of the drug's indication among physicians, a challenging prescribing procedure, or adverse effects. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Roflumilast Cream is effective in treating COPD."

In a case series of nine patients with severe Cushing's syndrome of ectopic or occult origin, cabergoline was used in combination with steroidogenesis inhibitors and showed rapid withdrawal of the steroidogenesis inhibitors and long-term control of the hypercortisolism in three of the cases. While the literature review found only 11 cases of ectopic or occult Cushing's syndrome treated with dopamine receptor agonists, 10 of these cases responded. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is possible that cabergoline may be effective in the treatment of Nelson's syndrome, a rare and severe form of Cushing's syndrome.

    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Based on the information provided, it is likely that progeria is caused by an autosomal recessive gene. The document mentions that mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene lead to the expression of a protein called progerin, which has 50 amino acids deleted from the tail of prelamin A. This mutation is known to cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by accelerated aging in children.\nThe document also mentions that both the amount and distribution of heterochromatin are altered in cells from patients with HGPS, which suggests that the mutation in the LMNA gene may affect the way in which chromatin is organized and accessed. This could potentially lead to changes in the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and division, which could contribute to the development of the symptoms associated with progeria.\nOverall, while the document does not directly answer the question of whether progeria is caused by an autosomal recessive gene, it does provide evidence to suggest that mutations in the LMNA gene may play a role in the development of this disorder."

The document states that ADAM12 expression is induced by TGF- and promotes TGF--dependent signaling through interaction with the type II receptor of TGF-. Additionally, the document shows that ADAM12 expression is correlated with EMT markers in human breast cancer cell lines and biopsies, and that overexpression of ADAM12L in a non-malignant breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A) is sufficient to induce loss of cell-cell contact, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, up-regulation of EMT markers and chemoresistance. These effects are independent of the proteolytic activity but require the cytoplasmic tail and are specific of ADAM12L since overexpression of ADAM12S failed to induce similar changes. The document also demonstrates that ADAM12L-dependent EMT is associated with increased phosphorylation of Smad3, Akt and ERK proteins. Finally, the document shows that inhibition of TGF- receptors or ERK activities reverses ADAM12L-induced mesenchymal phenotype. Therefore, based on the information provided in the document, Adamts18 plays a role in hormone receptor signaling by being involved in TGF- mediated EMT in cancer progression."
