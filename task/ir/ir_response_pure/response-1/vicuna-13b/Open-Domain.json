Despite its limited commercial success, the song saw Moyet awarded a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 1993. In a 1991 interview with the Liverpool Echo, Moyet described the song as \"basically a song about getting older\" and added that \"When you're young, you can go into things with an open mind. As you get older and experience all sorts of situations, you start to see things in a different way.\""
