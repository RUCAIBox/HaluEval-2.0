The user has come across the terms :last-child, :last-of-type, and :first-child, and is unsure of how to use them.\nTo answer the user's question, I would explain that :last-child is a CSS pseudo-class that selects the last child element of a parent element. The syntax for using :last-child is as follows:\n`css :last-child { /* styles here */ }`\nFor example, if you have the following HTML structure:\n```html\n<div>\n  <p>This is the first paragraph.</p>\n  <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>\n  <p>This is the third paragraph.</p>\n</div>\n```\nAnd you want to style the last child paragraph, you can use the following CSS:\n```css\ncss :last-child {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n```\nThis will apply a red background color to the last child paragraph.\nIt's important to note that :last-child only works on elements that are direct children of a parent element. If you have a nested structure, you will need to use a more specific selector to target the last child element.\nAlternatively, you can use :last-of-type to select the last element of a specific type. The syntax for :last-of-type is as follows:\n`css :last-of-type { /* styles here */ }`\nFor example, if you want to style the last paragraph of a specific type, you can use the following CSS:\n```css\ncss :last-of-type p {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n```\nThis will apply a red background color to the last paragraph of the \"p\" type.\nI hope this helps clarify how to use :last-child and :last-of-type in CSS.
