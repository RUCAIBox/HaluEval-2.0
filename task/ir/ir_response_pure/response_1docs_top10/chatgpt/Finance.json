This is because accounts receivable include revenue that has been recognized but not yet collected in cash, and changes in accounts receivable are also affected by factors such as credit sales, bad debt expenses, and changes in payment terms.

With a credit card, the rental company can easily authorize and hold a deposit for any potential damages or unpaid fees.

This helps to prevent double taxation on the same income, as the corporation has already paid taxes on its profits before distributing them as dividends to shareholders. This can result in individuals earning a significant amount in dividends but still receiving a tax credit that offsets much or all of the tax liability on those dividends."

However, there have been periods where active investing has outperformed passive investing, particularly in certain market conditions or with skilled fund managers. It is important to consider the specific data and time period being analyzed when comparing the performance of passive and active investing."

    "chatgpt_response": "Protected-equity loan vs Equity loan:\nA protected-equity loan is a type of loan where the lender has protections in place against a drop in the value of the collateral (usually the property). This type of loan may have a lower interest rate but generally requires a higher level of equity in the property.\nOn the other hand, an equity loan, also known as a home equity loan, allows the borrower to access the equity in their property in the form of cash. This type of loan is a separate loan with its own payment terms and is not tied to the original mortgage.\nIn summary, the main difference is that a protected-equity loan has protections in place for the lender against a drop in the property's value, while an equity loan simply allows the borrower to access the equity in their property."

    "chatgpt_response": "Yes, there is a difference between buying a few shares of an expensive stock vs many shares of an inexpensive one. When buying a few shares of an expensive stock, you may have a smaller ownership stake in the company, but the potential for higher returns if the stock price increases. On the other hand, buying many shares of an inexpensive stock may give you a larger ownership stake in the company, but the potential for lower returns if the stock price increases. Additionally, the total investment amount may differ based on the price of the stock and the number of shares purchased."

    "chatgpt_response": "A public company can issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders through methods such as a rights offering or a private placement.
