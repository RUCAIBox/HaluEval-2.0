We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn (Lyn(-/-)) mice. Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE, self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand (CD62L) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis. Basophils were also present in the lymph nodes and spleen of subjects with SLE. Thus, in Lyn(-/-) mice, basophils and IgE autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis, and in individuals with SLE IgE autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis."

This is supported by the document which shows that birth weight is a significant predictor of breast cancer risk in adult life and mammary gland mass could be an intermediate stage in this long process. We have studied the association of birth size measurements with mammographic density, a marker of mammary gland mass. For a population-based sample of 893 postmenopausal women without previous cancer in Sweden, we retrieved information on birth size from birth records and their most recent mammography. Film mammograms of the medio-lateral oblique view were digitized and the Cumulus software was used for computer-assisted semi-automated thresholding of mammographic density. Results were analyzed using generalized linear models controlling for possible confounders. Mean percent mammographic density increased when comparing the extreme categories of birth weight (from 15.6% to 18.6%) and head circumference (from 15.5% to 20.4%), and the corresponding linear trends were statistically significant (p values 0.02 and 0.007, respectively). The associations were particularly strong when the cutoff for high versus low mammographic density was set at the relatively high value of 50%. Compared to women weighing 3001-3500 grams at birth, women with birth weights >4000g were at almost 3-fold risk of developing high mammographic density (odds ratio: 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 7.9). No association with mammographic density was evident with respect to birth length which, however, is known to be less accurately measured. These results indicate that adult breast density, a powerful predictor of breast cancer risk, has intrauterine roots, as reflected in birth size."

Previous studies report that the activation of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) mediates the actions of catecholamines and increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a number of different cell types. The impact of the SNS on the immune modulation of social defeat has not been examined. The following studies were designed to determine whether SNS activation during social disruption stress (SDR) influences anxiety-like behavior as well as the activation, priming, and glucocorticoid resistance of splenocytes after social stress. CD-1 mice were exposed to one, three, or six cycles of SDR and HPLC analysis of the plasma and spleen revealed an increase in catecholamines. After six cycles of SDR the open field test was used to measure behaviors characteristic of anxiety and indicated that the social defeat induced increase in anxiety-like behavior was blocked by pre-treatment with the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Pre-treatment with the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol did not significantly alter corticosterone levels indicating no difference in activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition to anxiety-like behavior the SDR induced splenomegaly and increase in plasma IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1 were each reversed by pre-treatment with propranolol. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of cells from propranolol pretreated mice reduced the SDR-induced increase in the percentage of CD11b(+) splenic macrophages and significantly decreased the expression of TLR2, TLR4, and CD86 on the surface of these cells. In addition, supernatants from 18h LPS-stimulated ex vivo cultures of splenocytes from propranolol-treated SDR mice contained less IL-6. Likewise"

Document-1: INTRODUCTION Fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) is a mixture of particles with diameters smaller than 2.5 micrometers that are suspended in the air. Exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to adverse health outcomes, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, and certain cancers. OBJECTIVES This study examines the association between PM2.5 and anxiety prevalence. METHODS We used a cross-sectional study design to analyze data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, which included a sample of 337,493 adults from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We used a series of logistic regression models to examine the association between PM2.5 and anxiety prevalence, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS Our results show that higher levels of PM2.5 are associated with higher levels of anxiety prevalence. For every 10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM2.5, the odds of anxiety prevalence increased by 1.17 (95% CI: 1.09-1.26). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that PM2.5 is associated with increased levels of anxiety prevalence. This suggests that air pollution may be a risk factor for mental health outcomes."

Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.\" suggests that female carriers of the APOE4 allele have decreased risk for dementia."

Remarkably, \"high-throughput\" studies have recently solved the crystal structure of C8orf32 (Ntaq1).

NusG is a conserved regulatory protein that interacts with elongation complexes (ECs) of RNA polymerase, DNA, and RNA to modulate transcription in multiple and sometimes opposite ways. In Escherichia coli, NusG suppresses pausing and increases elongation rate, enhances termination by E. coli rho and phage HK022 Nun protein, and promotes antitermination by lambdaN and in ribosomal RNA operons. We report NMR studies that suggest that E. coli NusG consists of two largely independent N- and C-terminal structural domains, NTD and CTD, respectively. Based on tests of the functions of the NTD and CTD and variants of NusG in vivo and in vitro, we find that NTD alone is sufficient to suppress pausing and enhance transcript elongation in vitro. However, neither domain alone can enhance rho-dependent termination or support antitermination, indicating that interactions of both domains with ECs are required for these processes. We propose that the two domains of NusG mediate distinct interactions with ECs: the NTD interacts with RNA polymerase and the CTD interacts with rho and other regulators, providing NusG with different combinations of interactions to effect different regulatory outcomes."

This is supported by the evidence presented in the paper, which shows that loss of mtDNA leads to nuclear genome instability through a process of cell-cycle arrest and selection, which is not mediated by the absence of respiration and instead correlates with a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of cells undergoing this crisis identified a defect in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis, which requires normal mitochondrial function. Downregulation of nonmitochondrial ISC protein biogenesis was sufficient to cause increased genomic instability in cells with intact mitochondrial function. These results suggest mitochondrial dysfunction stimulates nuclear genome instability by inhibiting the production of ISC-containing protein(s), which are required for maintenance of nuclear genome integrity."

At higher concentrations (>30 nM), the peptide produced a sustained inward current. The potentiating effect of PACAP was nullified by prior incubation of the slices with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330A (25 microM). Further, superfusing the slices with the membrane-permeable cyclic AMP analogue N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (100-300 microM) in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (700 microM) increased the NMDA currents.

The researchers found that high-grade prostate cancer can be controlled with radical prostatectomy in some patients with disease confined pathologically, and 10-year cause-specific survival is 96%. Predictors of outcome in patients with Gleason 8 disease or greater are similar to established predictors derived by using all grades.

This can lead to a worsening of the patient's condition, more expensive treatments, and even hospital readmissions. It is therefore important for doctors to take the time to explain the treatment plan thoroughly and answer any questions the patient may have."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yes, it is possible to generate mouse models using artificial spermatids. This is because haploid cells are amenable for genetic analysis, and recent success in the derivation of mouse haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) via parthenogenesis has enabled genetic screening in mammalian cells. Furthermore, successful generation of live animals from these haESCs, which is needed to extend the genetic analysis to the organism level, has been achieved using artificial spermatids. This is because AG-haESCs can be used as a genetically tractable fertilization agent for the production of live animals via injection into oocytes."

IL-17 is a novel, CD4+ T cell-restricted cytokine that stimulates hematopoiesis and causes neutrophilia consisting of mature granulocytes. In this study, it was found that IL-17-mediated granulopoiesis requires G-CSF release and the presence or induction of the transmembrane form of stem cell factor (SCF) for optimal granulopoiesis. Additionally, G-CSF neutralization completely reversed IL-17-induced BM progenitor expansion, whereas splenic CFU-GM/CFU-granulocyte-erythrocyte-megakaryocyte-monocyte was only reduced by 50% in both Sl/Sld and littermate control mice. This suggests that there is a significant SCF/G-CSF-independent effect of IL-17 on splenic granulopoiesis, resulting in a preservation of mature circulating granulocytes. Thus, the assertion is supported by scientific evidence."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The statement is right. The document supports the statement by showing that ATM deficiency causes nuclear accumulation of HDAC4 in neurons, which promotes neurodegeneration. This is because nuclear HDAC4 binds to chromatin, as well as to myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), leading to histone deacetylation and altered neuronal gene expression. Blocking either HDAC4 activity or its nuclear accumulation blunts these neurodegenerative changes and rescues several behavioral abnormalities of ATM-deficient mice. Full rescue of the neurodegeneration, however, also requires the presence of HDAC4 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the ataxia telangiectasia phenotype results both from a loss of cytoplasmic HDAC4 as well as its nuclear accumulation. To remain cytoplasmic, HDAC4 must be phosphorylated. The activity of the HDAC4 phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is downregulated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation. In ATM deficiency, enhanced PP2A activity leads to HDAC4 dephosphorylation and the nuclear accumulation of HDAC4. Our results define a crucial role of the cellular localization of HDAC4 in the events leading to ataxia telangiectasia neurodegeneration."

Interventions Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was change in hemoglobing A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events. Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD,"

This is because genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now identified at least 2,000 common variants that appear associated with common diseases or related traits, and hundreds of which have been convincingly replicated. It is generally thought that the associated markers reflect the effect of a nearby common (minor allele frequency >0.05) causal site, which is associated with the marker, leading to extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites. We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create \"synthetic associations\" by occurring, stochastically, more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele. Although synthetic associations are an obvious theoretical possibility, they have never been systematically explored as a possible explanation for GWAS findings."

At 2 wk postinfection, IFN-gamma production, assessed by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokine staining, in the mutant mice was reduced by >50% compared with that in wild-type mice. By 4 wk postinfection, both mutant and wild-type mice had similar levels of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein production.

The authors also show that plasma BCAAs are also elevated in mice with early-stage pancreatic cancers driven by mutant Kras expression but not in mice with Kras-driven tumors in other tissues, and that breakdown of tissue protein accounts for the increase in plasma BCAAs that accompanies early-stage disease.

Mutant PI3K (PIK3CA) and loss of PTEN activity were sufficient, but not necessary, as predictors of sensitivity to the antitumor activity of the PI3K inhibitor PX-866 in the presence of wild-type Ras, whereas mutant oncogenic Ras was a dominant determinant of resistance, even in tumors with coexisting mutations in PIK3CA. The level of activation of PI3K signaling measured by tumor phosphorylated Ser(473)-Akt was insufficient to predict in vivo antitumor response to PX-866. Reverse-phase protein array revealed that the Ras-dependent downstream targets c-Myc and cyclin B were elevated in cell lines resistant to PX-866 in vivo. Studies using an H-Ras construct to constitutively and preferentially activate the three best-defined downstream targets of Ras, i.e., Raf, RalGDS, and PI3K, showed that mutant Ras mediates resistance through its ability to use multiple pathways for tumorigenesis. This suggests that PI3K inhibitors may not be effective against all tumors, and that patient selection and/or combination with other molecularly targeted agents may be necessary for successful treatment."

This is supported by the data from animal models of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) which showed that the systemic administration of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, also referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), results in the regeneration of pancreatic islets. Mechanisms underlying this effect are still poorly understood. Our aims were to assess whether donor MSCs (a) differentiate into pancreatic β-cells and (b) modify systemic and pancreatic pathophysiologic markers of T1DM. After the intravenous administration of 5 × 105 syngeneic MSCs, mice with T1DM reverted their hyperglycemia and presented no donor-derived insulin-producing cells. In contrast, 7 and 65 days post-transplantation, MSCs were engrafted into secondary lymphoid organs. This correlated with a systemic and local reduction in the abundance of autoaggressive T cells together with an increase in regulatory T cells. Additionally, in the pancreas of mice with T1DM treated with MSCs, we observed a cytokine profile shift from proinflammatory to antinflammatory. MSC transplantation did not reduce pancreatic cell apoptosis but recovered local expression and increased the circulating levels of epidermal growth factor, a pancreatic trophic factor. Therefore, the antidiabetic effect of MSCs intravenously administered is unrelated to their transdifferentiation potential but to their capability to restore the balance between Th1 and Th2 immunological responses along with the modification of the pancreatic microenvironment. Our data should be taken into account when designing clinical trials aimed to evaluate MSC transplantation in patients with T1DM since the presence of endogenous precursors seems to be critical in order to restore glycemic control."

Thus, thousands of genes showed sexual dimorphism in liver, adipose, and muscle, and hundreds of genes were sexually dimorphic in brain. These genes exhibited highly tissue-specific patterns of expression and were enriched for distinct pathways represented in the Gene Ontology database. They also showed evidence of chromosomal enrichment, not only on the sex chromosomes, but also on several autosomes. Genetic analyses provided evidence of the global regulation of subsets of the sexually dimorphic genes, as the transcript levels of a large number of these genes were controlled by several expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hotspots that exhibited tissue-specific control. Moreover, many tissue-specific transcription factor binding sites were found to be enriched in the sexually dimorphic genes."

IRG1 is a protein that is expressed in response to interferon, which is a cytokine that is produced in response to viral infection. IRG1 has been shown to have antiviral effects against neurotropic viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection strongly induces antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in the liver, yet it persists, suggesting that HCV can block ISG effector function. We now show that HCV infection triggers phosphorylation and activation of the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, which inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha and attenuates ISG protein expression despite normal ISG mRNA induction. ISG protein induction is restored and the antiviral effects of interferon are enhanced when PKR expression is suppressed in interferon-treated infected cells. Whereas host protein translation, including antiviral ISGs, is suppressed by activated PKR, HCV IRES-dependent translation is not. These results suggest that the ability of HCV to activate PKR may, paradoxically, be advantageous for the virus during an IFN response by preferentially suppressing the translation of ISGs."

According to the documents, Clp-controlled proteolysis in B. subtilis seems to play a substantial role, particularly under stress conditions. Calibrated Western blot analyses were used to estimate the approximate numbers of heat-inducible Clp molecules within a single cell. According to these numbers, the different Clp ATPases do not seem to compete for the proteolytic subunit ClpP. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed the predicted specific ClpX-ClpP, ClpC-ClpP, and ClpE-ClpP interactions. ClpE and ClpX are rapidly degraded in wild-type cells during permanent heat stress but remained almost stable in a clpP mutant, suggesting ClpP-dependent degradation. In particular, ClpCP appeared to be involved in the degradation of the short-lived ClpE ATPase, indicating a negative \"autoregulatory\" circuit for this particular Clp ATPase at the posttranslational level. Analysis of the half-life of stress-inducible clp mRNAs during exponential growth and heat shock revealed precise regulation of the synthesis of each Clp protein at the posttranscriptional level as well to meet the needs of B. subtilis.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "1. PIN1 is a membrane protein involved in the distribution of the plant hormone auxin, which is essential for the development of multicellular organisms.\n2. PIN1 is dynamically polarized in the roots of Arabidopsis, meaning that it is only found at one side of the cell membrane.\n3. This polarization of PIN1 does not require the VPS9a protein, which is involved in endocytosis.\n4. Endocytosis is a process by which cells absorb material from the outside, and it is involved in the generation of PIN1 polarity.\n5. Disruption of PIN1 polarity results in ectopic expression of auxin pathway-associated root-forming master regulators in embryonic leaves, and promotes homeotic transformation of leaves to roots.\n6. This shows that PIN1 polarity is essential for the proper development of multicellular organisms."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The statement is right. Advanced ovarian cancer usually spreads to the visceral adipose tissue of the omentum. The omental stromal cell-derived molecular determinants that modulate ovarian cancer growth have not been characterized. Here, using next-generation sequencing technology, we identify significantly higher levels of microRNA-21 (miR21) isomiRNAs in exosomes and tissue lysates isolated from cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) and fibroblasts (CAFs) than in those from ovarian cancer cells. Functional studies reveal that miR21 is transferred from CAAs or CAFs to the cancer cells, where it suppresses ovarian cancer apoptosis and confers chemoresistance by binding to its direct novel target, APAF1. These data suggest that the malignant phenotype of metastatic ovarian cancer cells can be altered by miR21 delivered by exosomes derived from neighbouring stromal cells in the omental tumour microenvironment, and that inhibiting the transfer of stromal-derived miR21 is an alternative modality in the treatment of metastatic and recurrent ovarian cancer. This suggests that the malignant phenotype of metastatic ovarian cancer cells can be altered by miR21 delivered by exosomes derived from neighbouring stromal cells in the omental tumour microenvironment, and that inhibiting the transfer of stromal-derived miR21 is an alternative modality in the treatment of metastatic and recurrent ovarian cancer."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that \"Mercaptopurine is anabolized into the inactive methylmercaptopurine by thiopurine methyltrasnferase (TPMT).\" is accurate. Document-1: \nMercaptopurine is an inactive metabolite of 6-mercaptopurine, which is an antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of mercaptopurine to its inactive metabolite, methylmercaptopurine. TPMT deficiency is a rare genetic disorder in which the body is unable to effectively metabolize mercaptopurine and other thiopurine drugs, resulting in increased toxicity. \nDocument-2: \nIn studies of oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, indices of chronic systemic exposure to active metabolites of these agents, namely, red blood cell (RBC) concentrations of methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs) and thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) have positively correlated with event-free survival (EFS). Our objective was to evaluate whether MTXPGs, TGNs, and the dose intensity of administered methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine were prognostic in the setting of a treatment protocol in which all treatment was coordinated through a single center, and the weekly doses of methotrexate were given parenterally. \nOn protocol Total XII, 182 children achieved remission and received weekly methotrexate 40 mg/m2 parenterally and daily oral 6-mercaptopurine, interrupted every 6 weeks during the first year by pulse chemotherapy.

This is because the N348I mutation confers resistance to zidovudine (AZT) by reducing the binding affinity of the drug for the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme. This mutation is one of the most common mutations associated with zidovudine (AZT) resistance and is found in over 20% of HIV-1 infected individuals."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The claim that NR5A2 is important in the development of endometrial tissues is accurate. Endometrial cancer cells express the genes encoding the steroidogenic enzymes involved in estradiol synthesis, which is regulated by NR5A2. Studies have shown that excessive exposure to estradiol represents the main risk factor for endometrial cancer. Therefore, it is likely that the abnormally high estradiol levels in the endometrium of women with endometrial cancer are due to overproduction by the tumour itself. This suggests that NR5A2 may be involved in the development of endometrial tissues."

This plasticity is largely multiplicative, consistent with a proportional increase or \"scaling\" in the strength of all synapses on the neuron. This effect requires a metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated rise in Ca2+ in the astrocyte processes surrounding the neuron and the release of the gliotransmitter ATP, which acts on postsynaptic purinergic receptors. These data provide evidence for a form of distributed synaptic plasticity that is feed-forward, expressed quickly, and mediated by the synaptic activation of neighboring astrocytes."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The evidence presented in the document supports the claim that the arm density of TatAd complexes is due to structural rearrangements within Class1 TatAd complexes such as the \"charge zipper mechanism\". This is because the presence of US2 induces the formation of class I MHC heavy chain conjugates of increased molecular weight that are recognized by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody, W6/32, suggesting that these class I MHC molecules retain their proper tertiary structure. These conjugates are properly folded glycosylated heavy chains modified by attachment of an estimated one, two, and three ubiquitin molecules. The folded ubiquitinated class I MHC heavy chains are not observed in control cells or in cells transfected with US11, suggesting that US2 targets class I MHC heavy chains for dislocation in a manner distinct from that used by US11. This is further supported by the fact that US2 and US11 show different requirements in terms of the conformation of the heavy chain molecule."

The document states that in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, an inverse relationship exists between GFR and stiffness of both central elastic and peripheral muscular arteries. This relation is independent from the effect of several confounders, including age, sex, and blood pressure values. Therefore, it can be concluded that GCS are not effective in reducing deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to hospital who are immobile because of acute stroke."
