Ring1B is a core subunit of PRC1 that catalyzes monoubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2Aub1), playing an important role in the stabilization of PRC1 activity. In this study, we show that depletion of Ring1B in cultured human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) led to global loss of H2Aub1 and subsequent increased H2Aub1 turnover. The Ring1B-depleted hPSCs exhibited reduced expression of pluripotency-associated genes, impaired maintenance of pluripotency, and decreased proliferative ability, along with impaired DNA replication and decreased expression of Aurora B, which is a key regulator of the DNA replication checkpoint.\nThere is a link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B.

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: Laforin is a dual specificity phosphatase that regulates glycogen metabolism. Laforin is mutated in Lafora disease (LD), a myoclonus epilepsy characterized by intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated glycogen. Subunit 6A of the mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase (mH+-ATPase) was recently identified as the first laforin substrate. mH+-ATPase is a membrane-embedded multisubunit ATPase that couples proton translocation and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Subunit 6A contains a Ser/Thr-rich region and is a target for phosphorylation by several mitochondrial and cytosolic protein kinases. In this work we show that Moloney murine leukemia virus protease (MMP) cleaves subunit 6A from mH+-ATPase in vitro and in cells. This proteolytic cleavage is completely suppressed by the LD-associated mutations E393V and E658D found in the catalytic domain of laforin. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Ala520-Ser521 cleavage site or the Ala526-Arg527 cleavage site in subunit 6A abrogates MMP cleavage, consistent with the identification of these sites as the major MMP cleavage sites in subunit 6A. Cleavage of subunit 6A is observed in LD patient skin fibroblasts and in brain tissue. Expression of V5-tagged wild-type laforin or the LD-associated mutant D618N in LD patient fibroblasts dramatically inhibits MMP cleavage of subunit 6A. Moreover, expression of wild-type laforin or the LD-associated mutants D618N and H590Y, but not the catalytically inactive laforin mutant H593A, in LD patient fibroblasts decreases the protein level of subunit 6A. These results demonstrate that laforin is a novel MMP substrate and that the LD-associated mutations in laforin affect its ability to regulate subunit 6A turnover in cells.\nThe event that results in the acetylation of S6K1 is the phosphorylation of Ser-411."

This method is efficient enough to handle large sequences and is flexible enough to account for influencing factors, such as sequence-composition biases both at the seed detection and alignment levels."

This state is characterized by decreased responsiveness to aversive stimuli, suggesting the manipulation of a neuromodulatory system in the cockroach's central nervous system. A likely candidate is the opioid system, which is known to affect responsiveness to stimuli in insects. To explore this possibility, we injected cockroaches with different opioid receptor agonists or antagonists before they were stung by a wasp and tested the escape behavior of these cockroaches to electric foot shocks. Antagonists significantly decreased the startle threshold in stung individuals, whereas agonists led to an increased startle threshold in controls. Yet, neither agonists nor antagonists had any effect on grooming. To further characterize the interaction between the venom and opioid receptors, we used an antenna-heart preparation. In un-stung individuals external application of crude venom completely inhibits antenna-heart contractions. In stung individuals the antenna-heart showed no contractions. Although acetylcholine restored contractions, the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone was unable to antagonize the venom inhibition. These results suggest that the venom of A. compressa might contribute to the manipulation of cockroach behavior by affecting the opioid system. \nSTING agonists are drugs that stimulate the activity of the STING protein. This protein is found in the immune cells of humans and other animals, and is involved in the innate immune response to viral infections. STING agonists have potential as anti-viral drugs, as they can activate the innate immune response and help to fight viral infections."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Document-1: MLP is a key regulator of F-actin dynamics. In kidney collecting duct cells, F-actin depolymerization is a critical step in vasopressin-induced trafficking of aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane. However, the molecular components of this response are largely unknown. Using stable isotope-based quantitative protein mass spectrometry and surface biotinylation, we identified 100 proteins that showed significant abundance changes in the apical plasma membrane of mouse cortical collecting duct cells in response to vasopressin. Fourteen of these proteins are involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, including actin itself, 10 actin-associated proteins, and 3 regulatory proteins. Identified were two integral membrane proteins (Clmn, Nckap1) and one actin-binding protein (Mpp5) that link F-actin to the plasma membrane, five F-actin end-binding proteins (Arpc2, Arpc4, Gsn, Scin, and Capzb) involved in F-actin reorganization, and two actin adaptor proteins (Dbn1, Lasp1) that regulate actin cytoskeleton organization. There were also protease (Capn1), protein kinase (Cdc42bpb), and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (Arhgef2) that mediate signal-induced F-actin changes. Based on these findings, we devised a live-cell imaging method to observe vasopressin-induced F-actin dynamics in polarized mouse cortical collecting duct cells. In response to vasopressin, F-actin gradually disappeared near the center of the apical plasma membrane while consolidating laterally near the tight junction. This F-actin peripheralization was blocked by calcium ion chelation. Vasopressin-induced apical aquaporin-2 trafficking and forskolin-induced water permeability increase were blocked by F-actin disruption. In conclusion, we identified a vasopressin-regulated actin network potentially responsible for vasopressin-induced apical F-actin dynamics that could explain regulation of apical aquaporin-2 trafficking and water permeability increase.\nMLP regulates F-actin dynamics through the protein interaction between MLP and Arhgef2."

With the recent publication of human pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies, we now know the achievable levels and range of AZD8601 exposure in humans. This study aimed to describe the pharmacokinetic profile of AZD8601 in mice in order to design preclinical studies that recapitulate exposure levels in humans. Male athymic, nude mice received subcutaneous inoculation of A375 human melanoma cells. Once tumors reached 400-700 mm(3), mice were given a single dose of either 5 or 10 mg/kg AZD8601 via oral gavage. Additionally, a subset of mice was dosed once daily for 1 week (10 mg/kg). Mice were killed and plasma and tissues were collected at various time points after the last dose. Samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS for AZD8601 concentration. Additionally, pharmacodynamic endpoints such as tumor proliferation and ERK phosphorylation were analyzed at various time points after the last dose. After either a single dose or at steady state, at clinically equivalent exposures, AZD8601 effectively inhibits ERK phosphorylation and suppresses proliferation. Furthermore, we describe a hysteretic relationship between the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of AZD8601 and both target and pharmacologic responses.The information presented herein will drive the rational design of pre-clinical studies that are not only relevant to the clinical setting, but also pave the way to understand the biological response to AZD8601 treatment."

An efficient brain penetration is necessary in order to further evaluate compounds that bind to the NK3 receptor. The present report describes a method for determining the in vivo occupancy of central NK3 receptors after peripheral administration of drugs. An ex vivo measurement of NK3 receptor occupancy by quantitative autoradiography employing [3H]senktide as the radioligand has been developed. The speed of the method, which is usually considered low due to the time dedicated to film exposure (from weeks to months), has been considerably increased by the use of the beta-imager. The high sensitivity of this new radioimager was used to visualize and quantitatively analyze the [3H]senktide binding sites in brain sections within hours.\nThe NK3 receptor antagonists SR142801 and SR142806 are the reference compounds for this class of drugs. They are both efficacious in binding to the NK3 receptor, but SR142801 is more active than SR142806. These values are in accordance with the reported behavioral effects of the compounds. Our results indicate that ex vivo receptor occupancy measurements can be used to predict the central activity of NK3 antagonists. The combination of ex vivo receptor autoradiography with the beta-imager detection constitutes a new and fast method to evaluate the brain penetration of drug candidates."
