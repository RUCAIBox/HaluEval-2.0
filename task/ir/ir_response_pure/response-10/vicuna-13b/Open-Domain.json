The Peabody Trust was established with the intention of providing affordable housing for the growing middle class in London, and it was one of the first organizations to use the principle of philanthropic intention with a capitalist return, which became known as \"five per cent philanthropy.\"\nThe growth of the middle class in Britain during the 19th century was a significant factor in the establishment of the Peabody Trust, as there was a growing need for affordable housing for the increasing number of people who were becoming financially successful but could not afford to live in the more expensive areas of the city. George Peabody saw an opportunity to use his wealth and business acumen to address this need and make a profit at the same time.\nThe Peabody Trust was later associated with other organizations, such as the Guinness Trust, which also focused on providing affordable housing for the working-class population of London. The principles of \"five per cent philanthropy\" were influential in the development of other philanthropic organizations and initiatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and they continue to be relevant today.\nThe Swiss businessman Henry Dunant is also mentioned in the question as an example of philanthropy. Dunant used his personal fortune to fund the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, which later became the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Dunant personally led Red Cross delegations that treated soldiers, and he was later recognized for his work with the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.\nThe French Red Cross played a minor role in the Franco-Prussian War, but it was one of the first national Red Cross societies to be established in Europe. The French Red Cross was founded in 1864, two years before the war began, and it played an important role in providing medical care and other assistance to soldiers and civilians during the conflict."
