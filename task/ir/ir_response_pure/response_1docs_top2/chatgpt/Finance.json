This can also provide opportunities for speculation, portfolio diversification, and managing market volatility.

    "chatgpt_response": "A public company can issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders through methods such as a rights offering or a private placement. In a rights offering, existing shareholders are given the opportunity to purchase additional shares at a discounted price, allowing them to maintain their proportional ownership without being diluted. In a private placement, the new shares are sold to a select group of investors, often at a higher price, in order to raise capital without diluting the value for existing shareholders."
