    "alpaca-7b_response": "No, Weaver syndrome is not similar to Sotos syndrome. Weaver syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a tall stature, a webbed neck, a broad forehead, and a short palate. Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by accelerated bone development, abnormal craniofacial morphology, and psychomotor developmental retardation. The behavioral problems associated with Sotos syndrome include poor social skills, anxiety, and/or irritability. Oral findings associated with Sotos syndrome include prognathism, a high-arched palate, and premature eruption of the teeth. Delayed psychomotor development increases the risk for caries. A personalized preventive treatment plan with close supervision of the patient's oral health care is required."

The median (IQR) JADAS-71, JADAS-27 and JADAS-10 scores were 11 (5.9-18), 10.4 (5.7-17) and 11 (5.9-17.3), respectively. The median JADAS and JADAS3 scores varied significantly with the category (Kruskal-Wallis p=0.0001), with the highest values in children with polyarticular disease patterns. Correlation of JADAS and JADAS3 across all categories was excellent. Correlation of JADAS71 with single markers of disease activity/severity was good to moderate, with some variation across the categories. With the exception of ESR, correlation of JADAS3-71 was similar to correlation of JADAS-71 with the same indices. This study is the first to apply JADAS to all categories of JIA in a routine clinical setting in the UK, adding further information about the feasibility and construct validity of JADAS. For the majority of categories, clinical applicability would be improved by exclusion of the ESR."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The viral KP4 protein is a chaperone that assists in the folding and assembly of macromolecular polypeptide chains, ultimately preventing the formation of nonfunctional or potentially toxic protein aggregates. It also suppresses immunoglobulin secretion by delaying the kinetics of immunoglobulin assembly and enhancing phosphotyrosine signals and intracellular calcium fluxes. Additionally, it appears to contribute to maximal lytic replication by enhancing viral glycoprotein expression levels and ultimately promoting infectious-virus production."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "No, ultraconserved elements are not depleted among copy number variants (CNVs). CNVs are a dominant contributor to genomic variation and may frequently underlie an individual's variable susceptibilities to disease. Here we question our previous proposition that copy number variants (CNVs) are often retained in the human population because of their adaptive benefit. We show that genic biases of CNVs are best explained, not by positive selection, but by reduced efficiency of selection in eliminating deleterious changes from the human population. Of four CNV data sets examined, three exhibit significant increases in protein evolutionary rates. These increases appear to be attributable to the frequent coincidence of CNVs with segmental duplications (SDs) that recombine infrequently. Furthermore, human orthologs of mouse genes, which, when disrupted, result in pre- or postnatal lethality, are unusually depleted in CNVs. Together, these findings support a model of reduced purifying selection (Hill-Robertson interference) within copy number variable regions that are enriched in nonessential genes, allowing both the fixation of slightly deleterious substitutions and increased drift of CNV alleles. Additionally, all four CNV sets exhibited increased rates of interspecies chromosomal rearrangement and nucleotide substitution and an increased gene density. We observe that sequences with high G+C contents are most prone to copy number variation. In particular, frequently duplicated human SD sequence, or CNVs that are large and/or observed frequently, tend to be elevated in G+C content. In contrast, SD sequences that appear fixed in the human population lie more frequently within low G+C sequence. These findings provide an overarching view of how CNVs arise and segregate in the human population."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The ERAP1-ERAP2 dimerization promotes the Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins. ERAD is an essential process for cell homeostasis and remains not well understood. During ERAD, misfolded proteins are recognized, ubiquitinated on ER and subsequently retro-translocated/dislocated from ER to the 26S proteasome in the cytosol for proteolytic elimination. Polycystin-2 (PC2), a member of the transient receptor potential superfamily of cation channels, is a Ca channel mainly located on ER and primary cilium membranes of cells. Mutations in PC2 are associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the PC2-associated pathogenesis remain unclear. Here we show that PC2 degradation is regulated by the ERAD pathway through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. PC2 interacted with ATPase p97, a well-known ERAD component extracting substrates from ER, and immobilized it in perinuclear regions. PC2 also interacted with Herp, an ubiquitin-like protein implicated in regulation of ERAD. We found that Herp is required for and promotes PC2 degradation. ER stress accelerates the retro-translocation of PC2 for cytosolic degradation, at least in part through increasing the Herp expression. Thus, PC2 is a novel ERAD substrate. Herp also promoted, to varied degrees, the degradation of PC2 truncation mutants, including two pathogenic mutants R872X and E837X, as long as they interact with Herp. In contrast, Herp did not interact with, and has no effect on the degradation of, PC2 mutant missing both the N- and C-termini. The ERAD machinery may thus be important for ADPKD pathogenesis because the regulation of PC2 expression by the ERAD pathway is altered by mutations in PC2."

However, the regulatory mechanisms of promoting occurrence and development of glioma have not yet been clearly elucidated. In the present study, the mechanism by which GDNF promotes glioma cell migration and invasion through regulating the dispersion and location of the Golgi apparatus (GA) is described. Following GDNF treatment, a change in the volume and position of GA was observed. The stack area of the GA was enlarged and it was more concentrated near the nucleus. Golgin-160 and Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP210) were identified as target molecules regulating GA positioning. In the absence of either golgin-160 or GMAP210 using lentivirus, the migration and invasion of U251 cells were decreased, while it was increased following GDNF. It was also found that the GA was decreased in size and dispersed following golgin-160 or GMAP210 knockdown, as determined by GA green fluorescence assay. Once GDNF was added, the above phenomenon would be twisted, and the concentrated location and volume of the GA was restored. In combination, the present data suggested that the regulation of the position and size of the GA by golgin-160 and GMAP210 play an important role in U251 cell migration and invasion."

Using genome-wide studies of EST and microarray data from human and mouse, researchers have analyzed the distribution of various subsets of alternatively spliced exons, based on their inclusion level and evolutionary history. They found that major-form exons are seven- to eightfold more likely to be contained in short introns (<400 nt) than minor-form exons, which occur preferentially in longer introns. This implies that novel exons arise more frequently in longer introns."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "ZCCHC17 is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system which contains the most diverse structural and functional members involved in the determination of target specificity and the regulation of metabolism. It has been well documented that E3 ubiquitin ligases, the key component enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, are involved in cotton resistance to Verticillium dahliae. In this study, GhPUB17, a U-box E3 ligase in cotton, was identified and its expression level was downregulated in the ssn mutant with a constitutively activated immune response. Furthermore, GhCyP3 was identified as a protein that interacts with GhPUB17, and the downregulation of GhCyP3 in cotton seedlings attenuated the plants' resistance to V. dahliae. These results suggest that GhPUB17 negatively regulates cotton immunity to V. dahliae and that the antifungal protein GhCyP3 likely interacts with and inhibits the ligase activity of GhPUB17 and plays an important role in the cotton-Verticillium interaction."

Subsequent chromatography on Sephacryl S-500 yields homogeneous preparations of the protein. This method is superior to other methods in that it does not require the use of detergents or organic solvents to remove lipids, and it also depletes surfactant and allows for the binding of exogenous SP-A in a time-dependent, saturable, and Ca2+-dependent manner."

Of the 23,056 SAGE tags that appeared more than once among the nine SAGE libraries, 11,156 tags representing 7,097 UniGene clusters were positioned onto chromosomes. A total of 43 and 55 clusters of differentially expressed genes were observed in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, respectively. The number of genes in each cluster ranged from 18 to 78 in squamous cell carcinomas and from 20 to 165 in adenocarcinomas. The size of these clusters varied from 1.8 Mb to 65.5 Mb in squamous cell carcinomas and from 1.6 Mb to 98.1 Mb in adenocarcinomas. Overall, the clusters with genes over-represented in tumors had an average of 3-4-fold increase in gene expression compared with the normal control. In contrast, clusters of genes with reduced expression had about 50-65% of the gene expression level compared with the normal. Examination of clusters identified in squamous cell lung cancer suggested that 9 of 15 clusters with overexpressed genes and 13 of 28 clusters with underexpressed genes were concordant with previously reported cytogenetic, comparative genomic hybridization or loss of heterozygosity studies. Therefore, at least a portion of the gene clusters identified via the transcriptome map most likely represented the transcriptional or genetic alterations occurred in the tumors. Integrating chromosomal mapping information with gene expression profiles may help reveal novel molecular changes associated with human lung cancer."

In this case, the patient presented with signs of Nelson's syndrome including skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation accompanied by elevated plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary demonstrated sellar enlargement with a 15 mm macroadenoma. The patient was initially treated with bromocriptine (10 mg/d) which had no effect on either ACTH level or tumor mass. Because of visual loss, transsphenoidal surgery was performed, with partial excision of the adenoma and chiasmal decompression, followed by radiosurgery. However, ACTH levels improved only temporarily, and then increased to previous levels. Therefore, cabergoline treatment (1.5 mg/week) was initiated. ACTH levels decreased dramatically from 1050 to 132 pmol/l, accompanied by clinical improvement. Repeated imaging studies demonstrated a stable residual pituitary tumor. This case demonstrates that long-term cabergoline treatment may be efficient in patients with Nelson's syndrome."

TFII-I binds to the core promoter region of genes involved in the formation of megakaryocytes, and mutations in the gene that encodes TFII-I result in a decrease in the production of platelets.

Here, we show that, contrasting common expectations, Pyrenean rocket (Sisymbrium austriacum), retained SNP diversity as this introduced plant species descended in the Meuse River Basin. Allele frequencies did not mirror between-population distances along the predominant expansion axis. Reconstruction of invasion history based on the genotypes of historical herbarium specimens indicated no influence of additional introductions or multiple points of entry on this nongradual pattern. Assignment analysis suggested the admixture of distant upstream sources in recently founded downstream populations. River dynamics seem to have facilitated occasional long-distance dispersal which brought diversity to the expansion front and so maintained evolutionary potential. Our findings highlight the merit of a historical framework in interpreting extant patterns of genetic diversity in introduced species and underscore the need to integrate long-distance dispersal events in theoretical work on the genetic consequences of range expansion."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The role of Adamts18 in hormone receptor signaling is to regulate the activity of the serpentine domain of the receptor by interacting with the ectodomain. Mutation of S281 in the ectodomain is supposed to release this constraint, thereby causing receptor activation. This segment is important in intramolecular signal transduction and the extent of disruption of the local structure of the ectodomain is related to the increase in constitutive activity. C283 and C284, the two consecutive cysteines that are highly conserved in glycoprotein hormone receptors, were mutated to serine, either alone (S281HSC or S281HCS) or in combination (S281HSS) and were studied in two different TSH receptor backgrounds. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ectodomain receptors showed good cell surface expression in CHO cells, but only S281HCS was able to bind TSH specifically, illustrating the importance of C283, or the putative disulphide bond, in maintaining the conformation of the ligand binding site. In contrast, cysteine mutants on an extracellular domain-holoreceptor background displayed severely impaired membrane targeting and were poorly expressed in COS cells. However, basal cAMP production, normalized to expression at the plasma membrane, indicated significant increase in constitutive activity of all three mutants, compared with the wild-type receptor."

The drug has been postulated to act via reduction of its nitro group by nitroreductases, including pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. In this study, we investigated the efficacies of nitazoxanide and a number of other thiazolides against Neospora caninum tachyzoites in vitro. We employed real-time-PCR-based monitoring of tachyzoite adhesion, invasion, and intracellular proliferation, as well as electron microscopic visualization of the effects imposed by nitazoxanide. In addition, we investigated several modified versions of this drug. These modifications included on one hand the replacement of the nitro group on the thiazole ring with a bromide, thus removing the most reactive group, and on the other hand the differential positioning of methyl groups on the salicylate ring. We show that the thiazole-associated nitro group is not necessarily required for the action of the drug and that methylation of the salicylate ring can result in complete abrogation of the antiparasitic activity, depending on the positioning of the methyl group. These findings indicate that other mechanisms besides the proposed mode of action involving the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme could be responsible for the wide spectrum of antiparasitic activity of NTZ and that modifications in the benzene ring could be important in these alternative mechanisms."
