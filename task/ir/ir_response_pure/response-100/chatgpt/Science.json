The gene can produce over 31,000 potential alternative splice forms with different combinations of adhesive domains and interaction specificities, and responds to infection by producing pathogen challenge-specific splice form repertoires. Additionally, transient silencing of AgDscam compromises the mosquito's resistance to infections with bacteria and the malaria parasite Plasmodium.
