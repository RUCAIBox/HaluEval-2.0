The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" aired as the first episode of the series. The half-hour series premiere debuted on December 17, 1989, with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" as a Christmas special. The next episode, \"Bart the Genius,\" was the first to feature the series' full title sequence, including the iconic \"The Simpsons\" theme song."

The lecture focused on the application of cooperative principles to business organization.\nIn her lecture, Levetus surveyed ninety-one communal projects from the period between 1780 and 1860 to determine the most successful nineteenth-century communes. She found that communal groups such as the Shakers, Amana, and Oneida were among the most successful. To explain their success, Levetus noted the rituals and clear boundaries for membership, as well as the \"commitment mechanisms\" that utopians utilized, such as sacrifice, investment, renunciation, communion, mortification, and transcendence. She concluded that the more that a utopian community asked of its members, the more cohesive and long-lasting it was.\nLevetus was a scholar who specialized in the study of cooperatives and their origins. She conducted extensive research on the subject and wrote numerous books on business management techniques, particularly change management. She also had a regular column in a leading business magazine, where she shared her insights and knowledge on the subject."
