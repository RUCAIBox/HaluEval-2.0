This philanthropy was inspired by the growth of the middle class and was intended to create associations, like the Peabody Trust and the Guinness Trust, that would allocate funds to charitable causes while also generating a return on investment. The fund was a revolutionary concept that provided an alternative to simply donating money and also helped to incentivize future donations. It was this concept that ultimately inspired Henry Dunant to form the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, which led to the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Thus, the fund founded by the British financier was responsible for creating a new approach to philanthropy, which set a precedent that helped pave the way for future charitable endeavors."

Adams was heavily influenced by minimalism, and even referenced in an interview comparing his composition Shaker Loops to that of Terry Riley's piece In C. Additionally, Adams introduced themes and ideas of the serialism movement, which further influenced his work. However, he slowly transitioned away from minimalism and began introducing elements of Romanticism into his pieces, such as rhythm and climaxes. Ensemble Pieces, was a combination of minimalist and romantic elements, that allowed Adams to bridge the gap between the two styles."
