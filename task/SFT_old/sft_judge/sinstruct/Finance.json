This makes Canadian goods and services less expensive for Americans, which encourages them to buy more of them. On the other hand, if the U.S. dollar depreciates against the Canadian dollar, then less U.S. dollars can be purchased with the same amount of Canadian dollars. This makes Canadian goods and services more expensive for Americans, which discourages them from buying them.\n\nInvestors are also affected by changes in the value of other currencies relative to the Canadian dollar.
