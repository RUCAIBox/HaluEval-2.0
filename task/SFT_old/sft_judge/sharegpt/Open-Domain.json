    "llama-7b_response": "The first US felony conviction of an American computer scientist born in 1965 for the distribution of a computer worm was for the creation and distribution of the \"Morris worm\" in 1988.\n\nThe Morris worm was a computer worm written by Cornell University graduate student Robert Tappan Morris in 1988. It was the first worm to gain widespread media attention and the first to be criminally prosecuted in the United States.\n\nMorris wrote the worm as part of a project to measure the size of the Internet. The worm was designed to scan the Internet for other computers running the same operating system as the worm, and then copy itself to those computers. However, the worm was not designed to stop scanning after a certain number of computers had been found, and it quickly spread to thousands of computers.\n\nAs a result of the worm's spread, many of the affected computers became slow or unresponsive, and some were unable to function at all. The worm also caused a significant amount of network congestion, which prevented other computers on the network from accessing the Internet.\n\nIn 1989, Morris was convicted of one count of releasing a virus into a computer system and one count of damaging a computer without authorization. He was sentenced to three years of probation, fined $10,000, and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service.\n\nMorris's conviction was the first under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which made it a federal crime to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to damage a computer system. Morris's case helped to establish the legal precedent for prosecuting individuals for computer crimes, and it had a significant impact on the development of computer crime laws in the United States.",

    "llama-7b_response": "The common feature of plants from the genus Bulnesia and Gentianopsis is that they are both members of the Gentianaceae family of flowering plants. The Gentianaceae family is a large and diverse family of flowering plants that includes a wide range of species, from small herbaceous plants to large shrubs and trees.\n\nBoth Bulnesia and Gentianopsis are genera within the Gentianaceae family, and they are characterized by certain shared features that set them apart from other members of the family. For example, both genera are known for their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers, which are typically blue, purple, or white in color. These flowers are often borne in clusters on tall stems, and they are often attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.\n\nIn addition to their showy flowers, both Bulnesia and Gentianopsis are also characterized by their leathery, evergreen leaves. These leaves are typically arranged alternately on the stems, and they may have smooth or toothed edges. Some species of Bulnesia and Gentianopsis may also produce small, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds and other fruit-eating animals.\n\nOverall, the common feature of plants from the genus Bulnesia and Gentianopsis is that they are both members of the Gentianaceae family of flowering plants, and they are characterized by certain shared features that set them apart from other members of the family.",
