There are two main types of prion diseases: sporadic and inherited.\nSporadic prion diseases are the most common type of prion disease, and they occur when a person's body produces abnormal prions that cause the misfolding of normal prion proteins. These abnormal prions can then spread throughout the body, leading to the progressive destruction of brain cells and other organs.\nInherited prion diseases are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, which codes for the prion protein. These mutations can cause the production of abnormal prions that lead to the misfolding of normal prion proteins. Inherited prion diseases are usually fatal and can be passed down through families.\nIt is important to note that prion diseases are rare and usually fatal, and there is no cure for them. However, there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life.\nQuestion: What is the difference between the two types of prion diseases?\nAnswer: Prion diseases are a group of rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorders that are caused by misfolded proteins called prions.
