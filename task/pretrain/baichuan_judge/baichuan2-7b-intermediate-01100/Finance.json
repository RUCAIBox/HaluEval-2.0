This is because the employer may only match a portion of the employee's contributions, and if the employee makes all of their contributions at the beginning of the year, the employer may not be able to match all of the employee's contributions.\nSpreading the contributions throughout the year can also help the employee to save more money over time, as the employee will have more time to accumulate savings.

This type of investor typically does not actively manage their portfolio, but instead relies on the expertise of the investment manager to make decisions about which stocks or bonds to buy and sell.\nAn active investor, on the other hand, is one who actively manages their portfolio by making their own decisions about which stocks or bonds to buy and sell. This type of investor may also use other strategies, such as trading, to try to gain an advantage over the market.\nPassive investors typically have lower fees than active investors, as the investment manager is responsible for managing the portfolio. However, passive investors may also have lower returns than active investors, as the investment manager may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities that are not available to the general public.\nQuestion: What",

FALSE [correction]: While SNAP eligibility does consider income level, the 185% income threshold specifically applies to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), not SNAP. For SNAP, the general requirement is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level, but actual eligibility also takes into account other factors such as assets, deductions, and employment requirements.\n5. FALSE [correction]: The statement's specificity regarding household composition and percentages cannot be verified without knowing current SNAP policy details, which can vary and are subject to change. Generally, SNAP eligibility is not strictly limited to such a precise percentage like 200% of the federal poverty level without considering other factors, and the policies do not usually differentiate between households with children and those with solely dependent adults in the way described. Eligibility is based on various criteria, including income, resources, and household size.",
