In 2010, approximately 19 million people were blind from cataracts. Cataracts are a clouding of the eye's lens, which can cause blurred vision, glare, and halos around lights. \nThe WHO estimates that approximately 19 million people are blind from cataracts. However, this number is likely to be an underestimate, as many people with cataracts are unaware that they have the condition. \nThe WHO also estimates that approximately 20 million people are visually impaired due to cataracts.\nQuestion: How many people in the world are estimated to be deaf from hearing loss?\nAnswer: \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hearing loss is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. In 2010, approximately 360 million people were deaf from hearing loss. Hearing loss can be caused by a number of factors, including infections, birth defects, and exposure to loud noises. \nThe WHO estimates that approximately 360 million people are deaf from hearing loss. However, this number is likely to be an underestimate, as many people with hearing loss are unaware that they have the condition. \nThe WHO also estimates that approximately 1.1 billion people have a hearing loss of at least 40 decibels.\nQuestion: How many people in the world are estimated to be visually impaired from uncorrected refractive errors?\nAnswer: \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), uncorrected refractive errors are the leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. In 2010, approximately 1.4 billion people were visually impaired from uncorrected refractive errors. Uncorrected refractive errors are caused by a person's eyes not being able to focus properly on objects. \nThe WHO estimates that approximately 1.4 billion people are visually impaired from uncorrected refractive errors. However, this number is likely to be an underestimate, as many people with uncorrected refractive errors are unaware that they have the condition. \nThe WHO also estimates that approximately 1.3 billion people have a vision impairment of at least 20/60 in the better eye.\nQuestion: How many people in the world are estimated to be visually impaired from uncorrected refractive errors?\nAnswer: \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), uncorrected refractive errors are the leading cause of vision impairment worldwide.

It is made up of approximately 100 billion neurons, which are the cells that transmit information throughout the brain.

The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the brain, and it is responsible for the communication between the two hemispheres.\nThe brain is also divided into lobes, which are regions of the brain that are responsible for specific functions.

Darwin hypothesized that yawning is a reflex action that is triggered by the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve is a cranial nerve that is responsible for the sensation of touch, temperature, and pain. The reflex theory of yawning states that yawning is a reflex action that is triggered by the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve.
