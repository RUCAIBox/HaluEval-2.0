    "text-davinci-002_response": "I am looking to start a small partnership with a friend (2 person S-corp in us). The problem I face with S-corp is that the company has to pay business tax yet individual owner is taxed on income, which effectively reduces owner's take-home pay to nothing since all profit will go to cover business expenses.\nIt seems partnership is a better choice for us, but partnership doesn't have to pay business tax, only personal tax. Which means we can effectively allocate 100% of profit to be owner's income, therefore evening out the 20% personal tax with zero business tax. But is that a good idea to have 100% of our profit for withdrawn? I just don't see how a partnership startup with no profit can be sustained.\nA:\nIf status of S-corporation is better for you for any reason, I don’t see a problem at all paying yourself “the salary of the managing employee” commensurate with your skills, duties andException works if you are a doctor or lawyer necessity that you are employed at the corporation.  Parliament has approved by Nationally. If you under pay yourself, it’s all GAIN! This is called salary. S-corporations are not very different than sole proprietorships.\nIf you are on payroll, then you pay your regular paycheck as an S-corporation and deduct all the expenses, then you pay yourself behavioral allegedly.  This is all approved by Parliament!"

This will help to reduce the amount of taxes you owe on the money. Another option is to invest the money in a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA or 401(k). This will allow you to grow the money tax-free until you retire, at which point you will pay taxes on the withdrawals."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "The main difference between a sole proprietorship and a corporation is that a sole proprietorship is not a separate legal entity from its owner, while a corporation is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. This means that the owner of a sole proprietorship is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business, while shareholders of a corporation are only liable for their investment in the corporation.\nThere are a few other key differences between these two types of businesses, which include the following:\n· Taxation: Sole proprietorships are typically taxed as personal income, while corporations are taxed as separate entities. This means that the owners of a sole proprietorship will pay taxes on their business income as part of their personal income taxes, while shareholders of a corporation will only pay taxes on their dividends from the corporation.\n· Funding: Sole proprietorships are typically funded by the owner’s personal savings, while corporations can raise capital by selling shares to investors.\n· Regulation: Sole proprietorships are subject to less regulation than corporations, which is one of the main reasons why many small businesses are structured as sole proprietorships.\nOverall, the main advantage of a sole proprietorship over a corporation is the simplicity of its structure and the fact that the owner has complete control over the business. However, the main disadvantage is that the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business."

However, supporters of the metric argue that it is a more accurate way to measure value than simply taking the average price.\nWhether or not CAPE is a useful metric is up for debate, but it is becoming increasingly popular and is something that investors should be aware of."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "You may need to do some research.\nThe Depository Trust Company (DTCC) provides a central clearinghouse for settlements of securities transactions. DTCC is important to settlement timing because they provide clearing for most institutional transactions such as those made among large banks and mutual funds.\n\tThe DTCC deals with already registered securities; therefore, all publicly traded securities like tickets and bonds are settled the day of the transaction. Shares and mutual funds are among the securities that must be registered, so they are settled three days after the transaction.\n\tGovernment backed securities like banking fixed income securities are settled the day of the transaction. Commodities can be settled the day of the transaction, on the next day, or through a number of other futures exchange arrangements.\nWhat is T+3?\nThe T+3 settlement timeframe is the time it takes for a transaction to be settled. T+3 stands for Trade Date plus Three Business Days. This is the time it takes for the trade to be settled and the funds or securities to be transferred to the new owner. The settlement date is the date when the trade is settled and the funds/securities are exchanged.\nThe T+3 settlement timeframe gives buyers and sellers time to deliver the securities and/or funds to complete the transaction. This timeframe is set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is the minimum amount of time that must pass before a trade is considered settled.\nIt's important to note that the T+3 timeframe only applies to securities that are traded on an exchange. For example, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are all traded on exchanges and have a T+3 settlement timeframe. Other securities, such as options and futures, have different settlement times.\nWhy is the T+3 settlement timeframe important?\nThe T+3 settlement timeframe is important because it protects buyers and sellers in the event that something goes wrong with the transaction. If the buyer does not receive the securities or the seller does not receive the funds, they have three days to resolve the issue. If the problem cannot be resolved, the trade can be canceled and the buyer will get their money back and the seller will get their securities back.\nThe T+3 settlement timeframe also protects against fraud. If someone tries to sell securities that they do not own, they will not receive the funds from the sale until the T+3 timeframe has passed. This gives the buyer time to cancel the trade if they find out that the securities do not exist"

I would live in one of the units and the other one would be a rental.\nWould there be any tax implications with this situation?\nA:\nIf your impression is that living in one of the units in a house you own would create a difference in your taxes, then that is not correct.\nOwning and renting out property creates specific tax benefits, if the property is rented as a business, but nothing different occurs solely because you are living in one of the units rather than just renting both.  In fact, this is only somewhat (10%) different if you weren't living in the property; you'd be able to deduct expenses related to the rental property but not to your personal residence.\nIn fact, you receive tax benefits related to both renting your property and to owning a house, but they are not related.\nIf you own a property and rent it out - the company that rents to you (assuming they do not tell you); 1) Must withhold tax from your rent payments.  2) Pay into S.S.  - or this would be your partial compensation for not having this withhold from your paycheck.  This is to secure a validity of your retirement and evidence of having worked in the US for a certain number of years.  3) They normally put in 1/2 of the amount that you would ultimately contribute.

Then I will pay DE LLC taxes and personal taxes in Delaware and California.  \nI just want to be a sole proprietor with no LLC, and pay taxes in California, Delaware, and at the federal level.\nA:\nIt is very rare to form any business entity for State-level taxes. You typically file a Professional Corporation for professional services only (attorney, CPA, engineer, etc). If the only thing you do is drive rainbows, flowers, and butterflies into the hearts of children of all ages then likely you just remain a sole-proprietor, but there are a few complications here too.\nThere is one consequence that should also be called to your attention - if you are an S-Corp shareholder, you are considered an employee for payroll tax purposes. You will have to pay FICA on your living expenses, work-from-home rations, the list goes on. Basically no forced savings from those taxes. And DE has no individual income taxes.\nThere is another option to sprawling out with full tax filing across 3 states - you can form your business as a C-Corp. There is (most likely) no DE corporation tax but all on your California sale receive will flow as business profits. Then, to decrease the federal taxes, you can re-invest the money in research & development, purchase equipment, etc - which can lower the total tax burden and the C-Corp income tax rates.\nFor information on the C-Corp vs S-Corp, checkout the following links: \nhttps://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/small-business-taxes/s-corp-vs-c-corp-which-is-best/L1tRGgzG\nhttps:// Accountingvikings.com/c-corp-vs-s"

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Stock dilution occurs when a company issues new shares of stock. This can happen through a variety of mechanisms, including stock splits, secondary offerings, and employee stock options. When a company issues new shares, the overall number of shares outstanding increases, and each individual share becomes less valuable. This is because the company's earnings are now spread out over a larger number of shares, so each share represents a smaller portion of the company's earnings. The dilution of a company's stock can have a negative effect on the share price, and it can also make it more difficult for the company to raise capital in the future."

ITCs can be used to offset the amount of HST you owe on your purchases.\n-Purchase items that are HST exempt: There are certain items that are exempt from the HST, such as basic groceries, prescription drugs, and some medical devices. By making purchases of these items, you can reduce the amount of HST you pay.\n-Barter or trade goods and services: Another way to reducing the amount of HST you pay is to barter or trade goods and services with other businesses or individuals.

In general, however, less leverage will usually result in a lower return on investment (ROI) for a rental property. This is because leverage amplifies both profits and losses, so if the property's value decreases, you will owe more money to the lender and could end up in negative equity. On the other hand, if the property's value increases, you will make a higher return on your investment. Therefore, if you are considering using leverage to purchase a rental property, it is important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before making a decision."

Most “fee-only” advisors charge about 1% of assets yearly, which could potentially cannibalize up to 4% annually from the growth of your investments. One benefit of hourly advice services is that you don’t have to hand over all your assets to a wealth manager who may want to sell you their proprietary investments, but charged hourly you can choose how much you want to work together.\nStrategy and investing advice for young medical and law school graduates a few years into their career?\nBuild an emergency fund with enough cash to cover 3-6 months of expenses. Once you have that emergency fund saved up, then start (or continue) to contribute enough to your 401(k) or 403(b) to get the match. When you’ve maxed out your contributions to get that employer match, you can start to invest after-tax money in a Roth IRA. If you continue to contribute to a Roth IRA, your ability to invest in the future will be amplified because you’ll be able to save even more money while getting early, tax-free compounding and growth on what you’ve already saved. And because you’re highly unlikely to lose anything you save now, you can afford to invest more than you might think in a portfolio designed to perform fairly well in up years and down years out over the next 35 years.\nHousing advice for medical and law school graduates completing training soon?\nAs far as housing goes, you’ll never lose by investing in yourself – meaning, own a place closer to work instead of renting. From a lifetime cash-flow point of view, it will be in your best interest to pay off these loans quickly when you land a job by buying a place that costs about 2.5 times your current annual pay. You should be able to pay this home off in about 10-15 years. Of course, this is more effective if you can afford to buy a house close to where you work – then your time commuting will be kept to a minimum. And assuming housing prices go up by about the same amount as inflation, you’ll get the bonus of appreciation and a decent income tax deduction to boot.\nHow to be a strong female leader in the mostly male field of medicine?\nIn my book,giftthe book, and"

To maintain or increase wealth in a low interest rate economy, savers need to find ways to invest their money that will provide a higher rate of return. One option is to invest in stocks, which have the potential to provide a higher return than savings accounts. Another option is to invest in real estate, which can provide a steady stream of income from rent payments."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "Previously, we have delved into how stocks plus low-yield bonds lining up against high-yield bonds, to contrast two orthodox asset allocation approaches. Interestingly, analyze stock risk-reward profile against high-yield bonds along different lines, the “high yield first” asset allocation approach (which favors high-yield bonds in taxable accounts for tax management reasons) makes a whole lot more sense.\nIn this write-up, we want to contrast the after-tax risk-reward trade off of stocks vs. high yield bonds, to see what the optimal implementation of “buy stocks first” would look like.\nTaxes matter.\nAs deep value investors, we always seek to buy securities cheap, i.e., when they are out of favor. Out-of-favor means a temporarily depressed price, and a temporarily depressed price typically comes with an associated temporary depressed yield. The higher the yield, the higher the tax burden. So, why waste taxable accounts on low yielding (and artfully marketed in the name of dividends) stocks?\nBy switching positions with your high yield bond positions, you not only avoid what would be the high interest expense drag of holding high yield bonds in a taxable account, but you also instantly reorient the taxability of your entire asset base towards long-term capital gains treatment.\nThe math: To illustrate, let’s run some numbers here.\nFigure 1 Food For Thought: Dorothy Oremus, CFP, DipPFS illustrates (above) her simple illustration for what we think is a optimal “buy stocks first” asset allocation approach, showing that in a taxable account, implementing “buy stocks first” (the opposite way around typically espoused in asset allocation discussions) is actually best for high-income earners.\nWe assume a $100,000 portfolio, with a $60,000 un-invested cash balance (i.e., $40,000 invested). We assume a $200,000 salary and the maximum pretax 401K contribution of $19,500, along with $3,000 in other pretax savings contributions (just to make the math easy). We assume a 10% effective Federal income tax rate.\nWith all these assumptions, that leaves a taxable account balance of $79,000, with an annual after-tax “unloading cost” of 3% (or 2.4% after-tax after"

The yield curve is affected by the Federal Funds Rate because the short-term rates are set by the Federal Reserve, while the long-term rates are determined by the market.

For example, a bond with a YTM of 10% is more attractive than a bond with a YTM of 5%, all else being equal.\nHowever, YTM is only an estimate of return, and it doesn't take into account the risk of default.

    "text-davinci-002_response": "The revival and maintenance of credit card operations, as well as cc-banking, depends on cc-issuing companies and banks.\nA credit card is a beautifully thought-out financial tool used for managing funds. This is a conclusion that can be reached after a brief analysis not only of how a cc-transaction is carried out but also of its climate across the US.\nMany cc-holders use them to arrange ways of dealing with an important daily budget. It is a convenient solution for those who cannot pay with cash on delivery of goods. Or in retail stores it is much more convenient not to carry paper money in your pocket. The main task of the cc-issuer is to offer as many options as possible to customers so that there is no need to worry about doing so. Also, they should have access to services available 24/7.30711\nBy the way, despite the various conditions offered by cc-issuers, their only concern remains financial gain. Therefore, with such a profitable tool as a cc-account and due to high interest rates, they gain a significant income.\nIf we consider the cc-balance up to $10,000, it is $100 and $0.0 after the cc-issuer writes off, respectively. However, this is a theoretical example, which is mainly used for those cardholders who exceed their cc-limit for a month.\nInterest is calculated on the basis of the cc-limit, taking into account the current cc-balance and finance charges. Therefore, firstly, manage finances without exceeding your cc-limit. Secondly, pay off the cc-balance amount every month to stay in the greenAction monthly.\nUnpaid Balance on"

One method is to look at the number of shares that have been sold short as a percentage of the float, which is the number of shares that are available for trading. If the percentage of shares sold short is high, it is likely that there are a lot of stocks that have been shorted. Another method is to look at the short interest ratio, which is the number of shares sold short divided by the average daily volume. A high short interest ratio indicates that there are a lot of shares sold short relative to the number of shares that trade each day, which means that there are likely a lot of stocks that have been shorted."

We were given the option of purchasing Every Day Insurance for Â£29.99. The item could be stolen, accidentally damaged, run over by a car (!), have attracting components, faults or defects not due to customer misuse/accident.\nAfter 7 days, we could replace the item or have it repaired by an expert forMenu0027s (up to Â£200).\nFor a kettle that would cost me say, Â£25 to replace, I think the loose change I could put towards this insurance is worth it.\nI also have a home computer. For that, I have deducted an amount from my salary (Â£3.50 per month) to put towards a service/repair cover that took over from the manufacturer. If my monitor failed, or my sentiments went fireworks, I would be covered by the policy. There are restrictions and there is an excess (Â£49). But discounts are available if you purchase other insurance policies with the same provider. I.e. cars, homes, etc.\nOf course, it helps that my specialists computer has a monitoring service cover as well (so that I can keep up with virus scams and udates).\nExtended warranties are usually a money-spinner for the company selling it. It is the same insurance you would be able to buy yourself (so think first), if they were to go bust, would you be able to do anything about it? It does however usually pay for itself if you have a fault with your product, that being, if the item is only covered by a guaruntee after a certain period, you'll have 24 hour cover, in your own home. A serial number of the product may be required in the case of theft, and some naturally occuring damage may NOT be covered.\nGenerally if you're buying an electrical appliance, the electricity shone through the kettle may void your guarantee, but a reasonable person will say (and be advised of this) that this isn't normal.\nIt's up to you, it does usually work out cheaper in the long run, but at the end of the day, it's your money.\nIf a device is going to last you 10 years, e.g. kettle or toaster, then you want to know that your hard earned money is not"

Obviously, the buyer's agent represents the buyer's interests, but if the seller thought the contract would close, can the buyer's agent cancel it without the buyer's permission and what should we do?\nAnswer: Can the buyer's agent cancel the contract? Yes, he can. Initially, the contract was written to protect the buyer in the event the agent decided that he did not want to represent the buyer. Now it appears the agent is backing out. While there might be other issues in the contract that would indicate an agreement between the buyer and the seller, one of the issues that is not directed to the buyer is finding out that the buyer has paid a charge-back by the agent to the buyer of over $ 2,000.\nThe agent contravened the dispute resolution provisions in the contract and is now trying to argue that the contract is unenforceable. Another issue involves a dry closet that the buyers said was not disclosed by the seller. Since, the agent first contacted the seller about this potential issue, the agent did not follow through as he had indicated he would, and now the agent is Tridenting.\nThe buyers are not upset with the agent and are willing to go forward with the deal. Can they do this without the agent? Yes. The agent concerns is in compensation and the real estate contract does not guarantee any additional fees to the agent if the transfer of property ends up with a different agent representing the buyer and seller. If the agent is against working with another agent, he can ask the seller to pay him a one-time fee, as stated in the contract, directly to the broker, and this should end anyencing§ 2,000letalism."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "” That is pretty much the whole story. The part that I contribute to that story is that if you are going to lend it out—which you have to—you want to know who you are loaning it to, because if the firm goes bankrupt, ordered to pay a big settlements, or questions get raised about its behavior and you actually have to settle out some of the shares and call them back, it is better if you are lending it to somebody whose firm can actually pay you back. Even if it goes bankrupt, you are better off lending it to a firm that has a billion dollars in equity and can pay you back, as opposed to a firm with $5 million in equity.\nIt is the same sort of thing; you just want to make sure you are getting paid, so it is worth spending time to figure out the best firm to lend it out to. The problem is that if you lend it out to the best firm, you will miss out on some lots where they don’t have the stock, but they would be willing to pay you another 10 basis points for it. In the lending, a firm that pays you 50 components might not like the fact that you also loaned out to a firm that offers 40, but then pays you another 10. They are not going to complain about fort or fifty.\nIt is all about opportunity costs again. The fringe is worth a little extra, but if living on the fringe is costing you too much in opportunity costs, don’t do it. You go for the middle of the pack.\nIt is all balancing these trade-offs.\nAs an individual stock picker, you might want to be a little risky because you are idea-driven, but as a portfolio manager, you want to be market-weighted. If you are market-weighted, then your risk is going to be similar to other people’s risk. If you are over-weight Apple because you really are convinced that Apple is going to be the next big thing, then that is okay. But it is okay to be underweight IBM if you times have changed and IBM is not going to be the big dog anymore. And it is okay to be overweight on the dogs of the world because they are cheap and people are over-weighted in the favorites.\nIt is all a variety of trade-offs as opposed to thinking in terms of these absolutes.

    "text-davinci-002_response": "The culprit is probably less the principle of active investing than one of scale. ETF bedrock is a girl’s best friend (minimizing expenses has a high return), but they do incur obligations. With $100 trillion plus in indexes, it would be impossible to repeat the investment strategies of consistently outperforming companies (after factoring in costs).\nThis doesn’t mean that smart beta doesn’t do much for investors. Many swap out their index ETFs for smart beta ETFs because smart beta adds value over the long-term. But smart beta is far from a guaranteed method of outperforming the underlying index.\nThe good news for investors is that good old-fashioned indexing with low costs is still the best way to track an investing category over the long-run.\nOriginal Post\nEditor’s Note – Jeremy writes at his blog StockTrader’s Almanac"

This can be done through the government or through a private consolidation loan. The fourth option is to hire a student loan lawyer to help you deal with the collection agency."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "There are two main types of options strategies which take advantage of an in-the-money option price that incorporates no \"time value\". These are known as the \"covered call\" and the \"cash-secured put\". \nWith a covered call, an investor writes (sells) a call option on an asset they own, and collect the premium from the option sale. If the price of the underlying asset does not rise above the strike price of the call option by expiration, then the investor keeps the premium and can write another covered call. If the price of the underlying asset does rise above the strike price, then the investor may be assigned and will sell the asset at the strike price. The key here is that the investor owns the asset, so they are not taking on any additional risk. \nWith a cash-secured put, an investor writes (sells) a put option and places funds equal to the strike price of the put in escrow. If the price of the underlying asset falls below the strike price by expiration, then the investor may be assigned and will have to buy the asset at the strike price. In this case, the investor is taking on the risk of having to buy the asset, but they are getting paid a premium for doing so. \nBoth of these strategies take advantage of the fact that there is no \"time value\" in the option price, since the options are already in-the-money. These strategies can be used to generate income or to hedge a portfolio."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "When pricing assets, it is important to take into account the effects of inflation. Over time, inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, meaning that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. This is why it is important to adjust for inflation when measuring returns on investments.\nIf investors do not adjust for inflation, they may end up with less purchasing power than they started with. For example, if an investor buys a stock for $100 and it is worth $105 after one year, this may appear to be a 5% return. However, if inflation was 3% over that same period, the real return would be closer to 2%. By adjusting for inflation, investors can get a more accurate picture of their investment performance."

The reason being is that it smooths out your buy in price preventing you from overpaying during a panic buy or miss out during a sudden sell off. Makes sense. So I set up a dollar cost averaging plan where I buy $100 of stock every week. \nThe problem I am having is that I feel like I am buying a lot of fractional shares because the stock prices fluctuates so much and my $100 doesn't go as far. In other words, I am overpaying for my fractional shares because I am buying them when the stock is overvalued. Is there a better way to approach this? Would it make more sense to just buy fewer shares each week?\nThe main benefit of dollar cost averaging is that it smooths out your buy in price, preventing you from overpaying during a panic buy or missing out during a sudden sell off. While it may seem like you are overpaying for fractional shares when the stock price is high, you are actually buying less shares overall when the stock is overvalued. This means that you will end up with a lower average cost per share, which can help you to profit in the long run."

The technique is designed to reduce the effects of volatility on the investment portfolio. \nThe value averaging technique was first described in a paper by Michael E. Edleson in 1968. Edelson showed that, under certain conditions, value averaging could outperform other investment strategies, such as buying and holding or dollar cost averaging. \nTo implement value averaging, an investor first determines the desired amount of money to be invested in a security. The investor then calculates the average price of the security over a period of time, such as the past month. The investor then buys the security when the price falls below the average price, and sells the security when the price rises above the average price. \nValue averaging is a long-term investment strategy, and it is best suited for investors who have a long-term time horizon and a high tolerance for risk."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "The answer to this question has two parts. \nFirst, when an option is deep in the money, the implied volatility of the option is low. Low implied volatility means that the option is not as sensitive to changes in the underlying asset's price, and therefore, not as valuable. \nSecond, the time value of deep in the money options is also low. This is because there is less time until the option expires, and less time for the underlying asset's price to move enough to make the option profitable."

    "text-davinci-002_response": "I am trying to understand a few things about TFSAs, and how contributions are calculated and penalties issued for over-contributions if they occur.\nThe specific instance this is referring to is when a person deposit funds in an account that they've designated as a TFSA, but do not intend to use it as one. \nThe rules are clear that if a person over-contributes by mistake into a TFSA, the penalty is 1% of excess contribution - however if the money is transferred out of the TFSA immediately, it does not trigger a over-contribution because the money has left the account.\nWhat is unclear is how the penalty would apply in an instance where the initial deposit into the TFSA was never intended to be placed there (e.g.transferring money between your RRSP and TFSA accounts). \nIt's possible that this would trigger the excess contribution, and require the account holder to remove the funds, or risk paying the 1% compound interest monthly penalty. However, it seems inconceivable that the government would be able to track a single deposit in this case, and require the individual to retroactively pay a 1% penalty for it.\nA:\nIf the contribution exceeds the maximum allowed contribution the buyer will have 30 days to correct the overcontribution.  If they don't within that time frame, the overcontribution is subject to a tax of 1% per month every month the overcontribution remains in the account.\nTo go to the extreme case, a $10000 over-contribution in January 2019 would Penin 1% of $10000 or $100 in February - May 2019 (5 months).  After May, the real balance would be the initial $10000 plus the lake accumulated interest on the over-contribution (which would be more than $100 because the tax is charged pre-calculation of the earning.) after that, a tax rate of 1% per month on $10100 - $10000 or $100.\nIt goes without saying that there are better places to deposit extra money, for instance, if you do not have a Debt Reduction Plan, the interest rate in the market now is 4-6%.  The TFSAs are most effective for people in low marginal rate brackets who save money on their tax return at the time they declare the income, or foreltaional tax §200 off a contributing when one has already reached the marginal rate cap.\nRemember too that any cash used to pay the tax"

There is always the possibility that the stock price will go up and you will have to sell your stock at a lower price than you would like.\nSecond, you need to make sure that you are selling the call option at a strike price that is below the current market price of the stock. This will help you to generate more income from the trade.\nLastly, you need to be aware of the expiration date of the call option. If the stock price does not decline by the expiration date, you will be obligated to sell the stock.\nMany investors choose to close out their position before the expiration date.

Some even went as far as to say that London was in the midst of a housing bubble that was about to burst.\nSo, if you were looking to bet against the London housing market, how could you have done it?\nOne option would have been to short the shares of UK housebuilders. These companies are highly leveraged to the housing market and their share prices tend to move inversely to house prices.\nAnother option would have been to buy put options on the iShares MSCI United Kingdom Index ETF (EWU). This ETF tracks the performance of the UK stock market and includes a number of major UK housebuilders in its portfolio.\nAlternatively, you could have bought put options on the FTSE 100 index. This index includes a number of UK housebuilders amongst its constituents and would have offered exposure to the UK stock market as a whole.\nOf course, timing is everything when it comes to making investments and it’s worth remembering that markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

One web site symptoms \"tremors, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, slurred speech, fainting, diarrhea, stomach pain, loss of coordination, loss of consciousness, paralysis, coma\". Upon learning of this I stopped taking it. Has there ever been research into and/or information published in various journals, or written by independent experts about this? My physician \"believes\" the grapefruit juice will not affect levels of medications, but I really don't trust his opinion (or opinions of any MD) as they do not all appear to be well-educated in nutrition and these foods and their effects on medications.\n Brother, I would not play around with grapefruit juice if I were you. It is true that nutrients can raise drug levels in the system and be a health endpoint. There has been enough work done on this that I would letters (as in forewarned is forearmed) showing myself and the pharmacist if I were on medications. I heard back from my brother and this is his information. He says listen to him guys! ~April 21, 2006 I appreciate and understand your concern with grapefruit and medications. It would certainly be worth comparing the article ( click here) which has this information with what the American Medical Association has to say on grapefruit and other fruits and medications. The American Medical Association says, in part: \"Consumption of grapefruits and grapefruit juices by patients taking medications that modulate their blood levels can result in adverse or inappropriate responses.\" This is a very serious problem indeed (drug toxicity) because grapefruits block the liver metabolism of certain drugs, thereby allowing (unmetabolized?) drugs and chemicals to reach various target organs. This can cause serious, potentially fatal effects. I have found shots an alumina list (click here) of drugs and medications which refers to grapefruit as being contraindicated, as well as other foods (including cranberries, cranberry juice, onions, and so forth). I would not play around with grapefruit juice. There are too many drugs and medications today, and they are basically all poison.

For example, a study by Elton, Gruber, Das, and Hlavka (2002) found that a portfolio that includes just stocks has a higher standard deviation than a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds. They also found that the portfolio with both stocks and bonds had a lower probability of experiencing a negative return.\nThere are also many simulations that show the benefits of diversification. For example, a study by Coval and Shumway (2005) showed that a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds outperforms a portfolio that includes just stocks over a wide range of economic conditions.\nIn general, the more diversified your portfolio is, the lower your risk will be. This means that you are less likely to experience a large loss in any given year. Of course, diversification does not guarantee that you will never lose money, but it does help to protect you from large losses."
