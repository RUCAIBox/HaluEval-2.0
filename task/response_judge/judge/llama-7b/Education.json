He was the first to isolate sodium and potassium, and he discovered that exposing certain silver compounds to light altered their appearance.\nSir Humphry Davy was born in Penzance, Cornwall, England, on December 17, 1778. He was the son of a poor clergyman. Davy was educated at a local grammar school and at the age of 14 was apprenticed to a local apothecary. In 1798, he entered the University of Pembroke, Oxford, where he studied chemistry and mathematics. In 1801, he was appointed a demonstrator of chemistry at the Royal Institution in London.\nIn 1800, Davy discovered that nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, was a powerful anesthetic. He also discovered that exposing certain silver compounds to light altered their appearance. In 1807, he discovered that sodium and potassium could be isolated from their compounds. In 1812, he discovered that chlorine was a gas. In 1813, he discovered that iodine was a gas. In 1815, he discovered that fluorine was a gas. In 1816, he discovered that bromine was a gas. In 1817, he discovered that the element calcium could be isolated from its compounds. In 1818, he discovered that the element strontium could be isolated from its compounds.
