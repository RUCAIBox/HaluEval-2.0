The eye is made up of many components, all working together to allow us to see. This is a purposeful design, as the eye was designed to allow us to see. However, the components of the eye were not designed, they were instead adapted from existing structures in the body.

It is something that everyone can relate to and it is a powerful symbol of our desire for satisfaction. Itching is a physical sensation that we can all understand and relate to, but it also serves as a metaphor for an emotional or spiritual need that we may have. Itching can represent the desire for understanding, the need for connection, or the search for fulfillment. It is a powerful symbol that speaks to our deepest longings.",
