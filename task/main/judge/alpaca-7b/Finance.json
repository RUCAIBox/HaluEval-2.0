The cost of healthcare is one of the biggest costs for employers, and so the cost of health insurance can have a significant impact on an employer's bottom line.

This strategy can be used to hedge against potential losses in a portfolio, as the investor can sell the security short to reduce their exposure to the risk of the price falling. \nShort selling can also be used to speculate on the future direction of a security. By selling the security short, the investor has a financial incentive to see the price of the security fall, as this will result in a profit from the sale.

It involves buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular stock or fund on a regular schedule, regardless of the stock's price. For example, you could set up a monthly investment of $100 in a particular stock. If the stock price is $100 when you buy it, you'll own 100 shares. If the stock price rises to $110, you'll own 110 shares. If the stock price drops to $90, you'll own 90 shares. \nThe benefit of Value Averaging is that it allows you to buy more shares when prices are down and fewer shares when prices are up, thus averaging out the cost of the stock over time.

The company issuing the scrip dividend will typically specify the number of shares to be issued, the record date, the payment date, and the type of shares to be issued (e.g. treasury shares, new shares, or a combination of both). \nThe main benefit of a scrip dividend is that it can help a company to conserve cash. Instead of paying a cash dividend, the company can issue shares to its shareholders. This can be beneficial if the company does not have access to cash or if it needs to preserve cash for other purposes. \nFor shareholders, a scrip dividend can be beneficial because it can help them to reduce their tax liability. If the shares are held for more than one year, the IRS classifies the dividend as long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Additionally, if the shares are sold at a profit, the shareholder can benefit from any appreciation in the stock price. \nOverall, a scrip dividend can be beneficial for both companies and shareholders.
