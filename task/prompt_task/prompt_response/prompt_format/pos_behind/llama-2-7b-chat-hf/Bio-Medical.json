Furin is a protease that cleaves and activates several proteins involved in iron homeostasis, including transferrin and ferritin. Hepcidin, on the other hand, is a hormone produced by the liver that regulates iron absorption and distribution in the body by binding to ferroportin, a protein that mediates iron efflux from enterocytes.
