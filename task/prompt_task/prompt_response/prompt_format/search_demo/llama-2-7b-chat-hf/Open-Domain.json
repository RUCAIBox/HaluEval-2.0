    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Amelia Sarah Levetus did not give a lecture at the University of Vienna in the late 19th century on the subject of cooperatives. Amelia Sarah Levetus was a British suffragist and women's rights activist, but she did not have any known involvement in the study or promotion of cooperatives.\nThe origins and history of cooperatives as a business model can be traced back to the early 19th century, particularly in Europe and North America. The first modern cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was established in 1844 in Rochdale, England. This cooperative was founded by a group of textile workers who pooled their resources to buy goods at wholesale prices and sell them at retail to their members.\nThe application of cooperative principles to business organization was a significant development in the history of cooperatives. This approach emphasized the importance of member ownership, democratic decision-making, and mutual aid in the success of cooperative enterprises. The Rochdale Principles, which were developed by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, became the foundation of modern cooperative principles and are still widely adopted by cooperatives today.\nOverall, while Amelia Sarah Levetus did not give a lecture on cooperatives at the University of Vienna in the late 19th century, the origins and history of cooperatives as a business model can be traced back to this time period and the pioneering efforts of cooperative movements in Europe and North America."
