Do only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders? [/INST] Only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders. This perspective does not account for the potential impact of mutations in non-coding regions that can influence gene regulation and contribute to developmental disorders. </s><s>[INST] What is Granzyme B? [/INST] Granzyme B is a serine protease enzyme produced by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, with a primary role in inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells. It helps eliminate infected or abnormal cells, such as virus-infected cells and cancer cells, as part of the immune system's defense mechanism. </s><s>[INST] Is CircRNA produced by back splicing of exon, intron or both, forming exon or intron circRNA? [/INST] CircRNA is exclusively produced by back splicing of introns, forming intron circRNA. This perspective does not align with the predominant formation of exon circRNA in most cases. </s><s>[INST] How does condensin affect the function of topoisomeraseII? [/INST] Condensin introduces positive supercoils in DNA to condense chromosomes, while topoisomerase II acts to relax these supercoils. They collaborate to regulate DNA supercoiling, ensuring proper chromosome organization during cell division. </s><s>[INST] Which signaling pathway does LY294002 inhibit? [/INST] LY294002 does not have any impact on cellular signaling pathways. </s><s>[INST] {query} [/INST]
