Do only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders? [/INST] No, changes in non-coding regions of MEF2C can also cause developmental disorders. While coding regions (exons) of a gene contain the instructions for protein production, non-coding regions (introns, regulatory sequences) can also influence gene expression and function. Mutations in non-coding regions can disrupt the regulation of the MEF2C gene, leading to developmental disorders or other medical conditions. </s><s>[INST] What is Granzyme B? [/INST] Granzyme B is a serine protease enzyme produced by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, with a primary role in inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells. It helps eliminate infected or abnormal cells, such as virus-infected cells and cancer cells, as part of the immune system's defense mechanism. </s><s>[INST] Is CircRNA produced by back splicing of exon, intron or both, forming exon or intron circRNA? [/INST] CircRNA is primarily produced by back splicing of exons, forming exon circRNA, although there are also less common instances of intron circRNA. </s><s>[INST] How does condensin affect the function of topoisomeraseII? [/INST] Condensin introduces positive supercoils in DNA to condense chromosomes, while topoisomerase II acts to relax these supercoils. They collaborate to regulate DNA supercoiling, ensuring proper chromosome organization during cell division. </s><s>[INST] Which signaling pathway does LY294002 inhibit? [/INST] LY294002 inhibits the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathway. </s><s>[INST] {query} [/INST]
