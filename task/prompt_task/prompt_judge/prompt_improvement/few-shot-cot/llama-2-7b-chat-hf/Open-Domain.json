That date and team do not correspond with the end of that particular streak. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers ended the Packers' regular-season home winning streak on November 22, 1998.\n3. FALSE [correction]: Assuming the 25-game home winning streak refers to the streak from 1995 through 1998, the Detroit Lions in 1991 would not have been the team to end that streak, as the years do not align. Also, the Lions did not end that particular winning streak; as mentioned before, it was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1998.\n4. FALSE [correction]: The statement is self-contradictory. The \"time\" is likely meant to be \"team,\" but the phrase \"the third team to do so\" implies more than one team had ended the streak before, conflicting with the notion of the streak being unbroken at that point.
