TFIIS is indeed a transcription factor known to enhance transcription elongation by stimulating RNA polymerase II.\n2. TFIIS does play a role in resolving backtracked RNA polymerase II by prompting the cleavage of the nascent RNA transcript that protrudes from the enzyme, thereby allowing transcription to resume.\n3. TFIIS can indirectly affect nucleosome positioning due to its effect on transcription elongation since the progression of RNA polymerase II can lead to changes in nucleosome displacement and reassembly during and after transcription.\n4. TFIIS’s activity can have consequences on chromatin structure, as the transcription process itself, including elongation, is inherently linked with alterations in chromatin due to the need for RNA polymerase II to access the DNA template within the context of chromatin.",
