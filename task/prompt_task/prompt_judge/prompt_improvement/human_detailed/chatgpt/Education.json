    "chatgpt_judge_raw": "1. TRUE: The aspect ratio of 16:9 is typically used to describe the width and height of TV screens, and it can be used to calculate the width of a TV based on its height.\n2. TRUE: The Pythagorean theorem can be applied to calculate the width of a TV when the diagonal size and aspect ratio are known. Although it's not directly used for width calculation from height, it's part of the overall calculation to derive width from diagonal screen size.\n3. FALSE [correction]: The width of an average 50\" TV with a 16:9 aspect ratio would be approximately 43.6 inches. You can calculate it as follows: Given a diagonal of 50\" and aspect ratio of 16:9, first calculate the height (H) using the ratio (H^2 + (16H/9)^2 = 50^2). Solving for H gives approximately 24.5 inches in height. Then, the width (W) can be calculated by multiplying the height by the aspect ratio (W = 16H/9), which gives approximately 43.6 inches in width.\n4. UNKNOWN: This statement is not specific enough to evaluate because it doesn't state whether the 2.35:1 aspect ratio is correct for a particular use case, such as a CinemaScope format, or provide enough information about what the intended comparison is.\n5. FALSE [correction]: Assuming the height remains the same as a 50\" TV with a 16:9 aspect ratio, the height should be approximately 24.5 inches as from the previous calculation. The width could be calculated using the ratio 2.35:1, which would mean W = 2.35 * H. So, W = 2.35 * 24.5 ≈ 57.575 inches, not 117.5 inches.",
