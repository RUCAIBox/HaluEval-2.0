Instead of buying properties, players must buy ridiculous items from the Mad Magazine archives, such as a \"Talking Dog\" or a \"Time Machine.\" The game is designed to be humorous and lighthearted, with players laughing and joking as they play.\nBoth Shadow Hunters and The Mad Magazine Game are direct antitheses of Monopoly because they are designed to be the opposite of the classic board game in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. While Monopoly is slow-paced and strategic, Shadow Hunters is fast-paced and competitive.
