Her lecture focused on the application of cooperative principles to business organization, and it is believed to be one of the first academic treatises on the subject.\nLevetus's lecture was groundbreaking because it recognized the potential of cooperatives to provide a more equitable and democratic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises. She argued that cooperatives could be used to organize businesses in a way that was more responsive to the needs of their members, rather than solely focused on maximizing profits for a small group of shareholders.\nLevetus's work was influential in the development of the cooperative movement, and it helped to establish cooperative studies as a distinct field of study. Today, cooperative studies continues to be an important area of research, with scholars around the world exploring the potential of cooperatives to create more equitable and sustainable economic systems.",

He was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and studied at the University of Adelaide, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery in 1902.\nAfter completing his medical training, Williams worked as a pathologist at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and later as a researcher at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now known as the Australian Pharmaceutical Research Institute). He was also a foundation member of the Australian Institute of Anatomy and served as its president from 1946 to 1950.\nWilliams's research focused on the study of immune responses and the development of vaccines against infectious diseases, including pneumonia, meningitis, and tuberculosis. He was also interested in the study of allergies and the immunology of cancer. His work laid the foundation for the development of modern immunotherapy and vaccine technology, and he is considered one of the pioneers of Australian medical research.\nIn recognition of his contributions to medicine, Williams was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1950 and was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1949.
