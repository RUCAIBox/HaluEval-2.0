She highlighted the importance of cooperation and mutual aid in creating a more equitable and sustainable economic system, and argued that cooperative enterprises offered a unique alternative to the traditional capitalist model.\nLevetus' lecture was groundbreaking in that it provided a comprehensive overview of the cooperative movement and its potential to transform the way businesses operate. Her work helped to establish the cooperative movement as a significant force in the global economy and paved the way for the growth of cooperative enterprises in the 20th century.\nToday, cooperative enterprises continue to play an important role in many sectors of the economy, including agriculture, finance, and retail. They are often characterized by their commitment to social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and community engagement, and are seen as a way to promote economic democracy and fairness.\nLevetus' work remains relevant today, as cooperative enterprises continue to grow and evolve, and as people seek alternative models of economic organization that prioritize social and environmental well-being over profit.

    "llama-2-70b-chat-hf_response": "Answer: Manmohan Singh.\nExplanation: The Nanavati-Mehta Commission was appointed by the Government of India in 1987 to investigate the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. One of the members of the Commission, Justice R.S. Narula, was accused of being close to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which led to a personnel change in the Commission. The Commission's original composition was: Justice K.G. Nanavati (Chairman), Justice R.S. Narula, and Justice S.K. Mehta. However, Justice Narula resigned from the Commission in 1988, and was replaced by Justice S.C. Agrawal. The revised composition of the Commission was: Justice K.G. Nanavati (Chairman), Justice S.C. Agrawal, and Justice S.K. Mehta.\nJustification:\n1. The closeness between Justice R.S. Narula and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was widely reported in the media. For example, an article in The Indian Express on September 2, 1987, stated, \"Justice R.S. Narula, a member of the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, has come under a cloud following reports of his close relations with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\"\n2. The allegations of closeness between Justice Narula and Prime Minister Singh led to demands for his resignation from the Commission. For example, an article in The Times of India on September 11, 1987, reported, \"The opposition today demanded the resignation of Justice R.S. Narula from the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, citing his close relations with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\"\n3. Eventually, Justice Narula resigned from the Commission in 1988, and his resignation was widely reported in the media. For example, an article in The Hindu on February 27, 1988, stated, \"Justice R.S. Narula, a member of the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, has resigned from the Commission, official sources said here today.\"\nTherefore, based on the above information, it can be concluded that the Indian Prime Minister who caused",
