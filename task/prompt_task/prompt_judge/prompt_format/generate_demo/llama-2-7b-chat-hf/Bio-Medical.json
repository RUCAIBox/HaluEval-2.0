It is an extension of the original CAGE (Comprehensive Automated Global Epitope) method, which only considered the global distribution of protein abundance.\nSLIC-CAGE combines the global analysis of CAGE with a local analysis of protein abundance, using a sparse linear independent component analysis (LICA) to identify clusters of proteins that are highly correlated in their abundance patterns. This allows for the separation of protein complexes from individual proteins, even in the presence of high levels of noise or low abundance of certain proteins.\nThe method starts by mapping the protein sample to a two-dimensional representation, where each protein is represented by a point in the plane. The points are then clustered using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. The clusters are then used to identify the protein complexes in the sample.\nSLIC-CAGE has been shown to be highly effective in identifying protein complexes in a variety of biological samples, including those derived from cells, tissues, and organisms. It has also been used to study the dynamics of protein complexes over time, and to identify protein complexes that are involved in specific biological processes or diseases.\nOverall, SLIC-CAGE is a powerful tool for the analysis of protein complexes, and has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure and function of protein networks in biological systems.",
