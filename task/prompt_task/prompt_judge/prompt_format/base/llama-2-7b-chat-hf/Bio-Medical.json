    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Adamts18 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 18) is involved in the regulation of hormone receptor signaling, particularly in the context of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling. Adamts18 modulates ERα activity by cleaving and inhibiting the activity of the ERα ligand binding domain, thereby influencing the response to estrogen in various cell types.",
