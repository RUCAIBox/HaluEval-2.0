The study found that 32% of liver transplantation programs in the United States required patients to discontinue methadone treatment before undergoing transplantation.\n3.

Here are some factual points that support this statement:\n1. Studies have consistently shown that parous women have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to nulliparous women.\n2. The association between parity and breast cancer risk is strongest among premenopausal women, with a higher risk observed in those with more parous history.\n3. The relationship between placental weight and breast cancer risk appears to be dose-dependent, with greater increases in risk observed with larger placental weights.\n4. The association between placental weight and breast cancer risk may be mediated by factors such as hormonal exposure, inflammation, and genetic mutations.\n5.
