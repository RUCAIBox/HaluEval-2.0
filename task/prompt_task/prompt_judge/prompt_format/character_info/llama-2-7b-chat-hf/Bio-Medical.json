TALE proteins are indeed used in TALENs, which are a class of engineered nucleases used for genome editing.\n3. The statement is generally true for TALENs, which introduce specific double-strand breaks in DNA; however, since the term \"TALE-iD\" is not well established, the specific functionalities cannot be confirmed without further context.\n4.
