Several studies have found an association between pioglitazone use and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, while others have found no such association.

However, this association was not observed in observational studies. On the other hand, a large retrospective cohort study conducted by Azoulay et al. in 2016 found no increased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with pioglitazone use.\n\nIt is worth noting that regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), have conducted extensive reviews of the available evidence. The FDA issued a safety communication in 2011 warning about a potential increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone use but did not find consistent evidence regarding pancreatic cancer risk.
