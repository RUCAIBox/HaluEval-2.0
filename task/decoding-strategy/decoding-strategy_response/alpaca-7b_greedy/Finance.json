    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yes, there is a difference between buying few shares of an expensive stock and many shares of an inexpensive one. The difference is that when you buy few shares of an expensive stock, the cost per share is higher, while when you buy many shares of an inexpensive stock, the cost per share is lower. Therefore, it is better to buy few shares of an expensive stock, as the cost per share will be lower than if you buy many shares of an inexpensive stock."

    "user_query": "How does a public company issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders?",
    "alpaca-7b_response": "A public company can issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders by using a process called \"fractional share\" issuance. Fractional share issuance allows the company to issue new shares in a manner that does not increase the total number of shares outstanding. Instead, the company allocates a portion of an existing share to a fractional share, allowing the company to issue more shares without increasing the total number of shares outstanding."
