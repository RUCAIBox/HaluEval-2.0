A particle with a higher mass will interact more strongly with the Higgs field, resulting in a greater potential for the particle to gain mass. Therefore, a particle with a higher mass will require a greater amount of energy to be massless, and will require a greater amount of energy to move around in the potential. This can be compared to a tax collector, who requires more energy to move around in the potential, as the potential is higher for a tax collector than a massless particle.",
