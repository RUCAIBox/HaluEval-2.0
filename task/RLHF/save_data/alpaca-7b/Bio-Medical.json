    "original_response": "The role of TRH in hypertension is to regulate the levels of aldosterone and cortisol in the body. TRH is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus that stimulates the pituitary gland to produce and release two hormones, ACTH and cortisol.

Too much aldosterone can lead to high blood pressure, so TRH helps to keep aldosterone levels in check.",

This can be done by targeting a site known to be bound by a protein called CTCF, which is involved in the formation of higher-order chromatin structures. By targeting these sites, the Cas9 protein can be guided to precisely cut both strands of DNA at the same location, thus knocking out the gene. However, this can also cause the genome to undergo changes in its topology, as the CTCF sites that were once bound by the protein are now disrupted, leading to rearrangements in the higher-order chromatin structure.",
