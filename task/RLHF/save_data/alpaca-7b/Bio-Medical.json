Shotgun lipidomics is a mass spectrometry-based technique used to identify and quantify lipids in a sample. It involves the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer, but the sample is first broken down into smaller particles through the use of a shotgun approach. This allows for the analysis of a larger range of lipids and provides more information about the lipids present in the sample.",
