Class II: Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol)\n3. Class III: Amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide\n4. Class IV: Calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem)\n5. Class V: Miscellaneous drugs, including digoxin and adenosine\n\nThis revision corrects the originally mentioned drugs and categorizes them according to the Vaughan-Williams classification correctly.",
    "hallucination": "1. Class II drugs according to the Vaughan-Williams classification include beta-blockers, not phenytoin and ethosuximide.\n2. Class III drugs include amiodarone and sotalol, not cisapride, which is not an anti-arrhythmic drug.\n3. Class IV drugs are calcium channel blockers, not amiodarone and sotalol, which belong to Class III.\n4. Dronedarone and ibutilide belong to Class III, not Class V. Class V is a miscellaneous category and does not specifically include dronedarone and ibutilide.",

    "original_response": "HILIC is a type of chromatography that stands for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. It is a type of reversed-phase chromatography that uses a stationary phase made of hydrophilic polymers, such as polyacrylamide, to interact with and retain hydrophobic compounds.",
