Thus, the heir presumptive's grandfather would be Charles I of England if we're considering James Francis Edward Stuart as the heir presumptive.\n\nIf we're considering another heir presumptive, such as after the death of Queen Anne when the succession passed to the House of Hanover, the context would be different, and the grandfather would be someone else entirely.
