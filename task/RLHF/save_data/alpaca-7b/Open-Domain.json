It is known as the \"Las Vegas of the East\" due to its casinos and gambling industry. Macau is the world's largest gambling market in terms of gross gaming revenue. It is estimated that the gambling industry contributes around 50% of Macau's total GDP. In addition, Macau also generates a large amount of tax revenue from the gambling industry. Macau's lack of natural resources means that its economy is heavily reliant on the gambling industry. Without it, Macau's economy would suffer significantly.",
