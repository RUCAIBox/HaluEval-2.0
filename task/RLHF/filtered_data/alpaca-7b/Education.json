    "original_response": "The Shakespeare identity debate has been ongoing for centuries, with scholars using a variety of methods to attempt to identify the Bard of Avon. In the early years, arguments were largely based on textual analysis, with scholars examining the works of Shakespeare to identify his biographical and cultural references. In more recent decades, however, biographical and forensic evidence has been used to attempt to identify the playwright. DNA testing, handwriting analysis, and other forensic methods have been employed to try to prove or disprove theories surrounding the identity of Shakespeare. Scholars have also used historical records, portraits, and other evidence to make their cases. Despite the decades of debate, no conclusive evidence has been found to definitively identify the author of the works attributed to Shakespeare.",

This new strain was more easily spread from person to person, and caused more severe illness than the previous strains. \nThis phenomenon of new strains of the virus emerging every 20-40 years is due to the way the virus mutates and changes over time.

In the animal kingdom, the Fibonacci sequence is often used to study the movement of animals, such as ants and fish, in order to understand their behavior. In physics, the Fibonacci sequence is used to model the motion of objects in a variety of ways, such as the motion of a pendulum or the trajectory of a projectile. In engineering, the Fibonacci sequence is used to design structures and architectures, such as the Golden Ratio used in the design of the Parthenon in Athens. Finally, in finance, the Fibonacci sequence is used to model the movement of financial prices, such as stocks and commodities, in order to identify potential trading opportunities.",
