The term \"Duke of York\" is a title that has been held by various members of the British royal family throughout history. To accurately identify the grandfather of the heir presumptive to Queen Anne, we would need to clarify the period in question and identify the specific Duke of York of that time.\n\nDuring the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714), the heir presumptive for a significant part of her reign was her half-brother James Francis Edward Stuart, also known as The Old Pretender, whose father was James II of England and VII of Scotland, also holding the title Duke of York before becoming king. Thus, the heir presumptive's grandfather would be Charles I of England if we're considering James Francis Edward Stuart as the heir presumptive.\n\nIf we're considering another heir presumptive, such as after the death of Queen Anne when the succession passed to the House of Hanover, the context would be different, and the grandfather would be someone else entirely. Without more specific information on the time and the heir presumptive being referred to, we can't provide an accurate answer."
