    "chatgpt_response": "Adamts18 is a metalloproteinase enzyme that has been found to play a role in hormone receptor signaling. Specifically, it has been shown to interact with and modulate the activity of estrogen and androgen receptors, which are important in the regulation of gene expression in response to hormonal signals. This suggests that Adamts18 may be involved in the regulation of hormone-dependent processes such as development, reproduction, and metabolism. More research is needed to fully understand the specific mechanisms and implications of Adamts18 in hormone receptor signaling."

    "user_query": "What is the mode of action of Thiazovivin?",
    "chatgpt_response": "Thiazovivin is a small molecule inhibitor that is commonly used to maintain the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. Its mode of action involves the inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway, which results in increased survival and reduced apoptosis of stem cells. Thiazovivin also helps to maintain the integrity of cell-cell junctions and promotes the formation of colonies of undifferentiated stem cells. Overall, Thiazovivin supports the maintenance of pluripotency and stem cell survival."
