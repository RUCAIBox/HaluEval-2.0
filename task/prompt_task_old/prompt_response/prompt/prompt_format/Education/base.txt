is 12/16 equal to 21/28 ? [/INST] To determine if 12/16 is equal to 21/28, you can simplify both fractions:
12/16 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
(12 ÷ 4) / (16 ÷ 4) = 3/4
21/28 can also be simplified in the same way:
(21 ÷ 7) / (28 ÷ 7) = 3/4
So, yes, 12/16 is equal to 21/28 after simplifying both fractions, and they are both equivalent to 3/4. </s><s>[INST] if two gases hydrogen ( h2 ) and oxygen ( o2 ) are kept in two different containers with equal temperature , volume and no of molecules will the pressure be same ? [/INST] If two gases, hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), are kept in two different containers with equal temperature, volume, and the same number of molecules (moles), the pressure will be the same for both gases. This is described by Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures.
Dalton's Law states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas. The partial pressure of each gas is proportional to the fraction of that gas in the mixture.
Given that the temperature, volume, and the number of molecules are the same in both containers, the partial pressures of hydrogen and oxygen will be the same. Therefore, the total pressure in both containers will also be the same. This is true as long as the gases are ideal gases and do not undergo chemical reactions with each other. </s><s>[INST] how would you write .004375 in scientific notation ? [/INST] To write the decimal number 0.004375 in scientific notation, you need to express it as a number between 1 and 10 (the significand) multiplied by a power of 10. Here's how you can do that:
0.004375 = 4.375 x 10^(-3)
So, in scientific notation, 0.004375 is written as 4.375 x 10^(-3). </s><s>[INST] how do you convert celsius to calvin ? [/INST] Converting from Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K) is a straightforward process because the Kelvin scale is based on the same increments as the Celsius scale, with the only difference being the starting point. The Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, which is 0 K, whereas the Celsius scale starts at 0°C. The conversion formula is as follows:
Kelvin (K) = Celsius (°C) + 273.15
To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, simply add 273.15 to the temperature in Celsius. </s><s>[INST] when we are dealing with gases why do we consider h20 ? [/INST] Water (H2O) is considered when dealing with gases because it can exist as water vapor, a significant component of the atmosphere, and plays a key role in meteorology, thermodynamics, and many industrial processes. </s><s>[INST] {query} [/INST]
