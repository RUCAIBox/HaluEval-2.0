A falling dollar can contribute to inflation, as imports become more expensive, potentially increasing the overall price level within the economy.\n4. A falling dollar can put upward pressure on interest rates, especially if the Federal Reserve responds to inflationary pressures by hiking rates to maintain the value of the currency.\n5.
