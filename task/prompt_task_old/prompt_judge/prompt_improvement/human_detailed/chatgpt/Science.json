    "chatgpt_response": "The statement that the risk of breast cancer among parous women increases with placental weight of pregnancies, and this association is strongest for premenopausal breast cancer, is supported by several factual points:\n\n1. Studies have shown a positive correlation between placental weight and the risk of breast cancer in parous women, particularly in premenopausal women. This association may be attributed to the hormonal and physiological changes during pregnancy that could impact breast cancer risk.\n\n2. One study published in the International Journal of Cancer found that higher placental weight was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in parous women, especially before menopause.\n\n3. The relationship between placental weight and breast cancer risk may be influenced by factors such as estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy, as well as the growth-promoting effects of placental hormones.\n\n4. The association between placental weight and breast cancer risk may be related to the duration and intensity of the hormonal changes during pregnancy, as these factors could impact the development and behavior of breast tissue.\n\n5. It is important to note that while there is evidence supporting the association between placental weight and breast cancer risk, there are likely other contributing factors to consider, such as genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors, which may also influence breast cancer risk in parous women.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement that the risk of breast cancer among parous women increases with placental weight of pregnancies, and this association is strongest for premenopausal breast cancer, is supported by evidence from research studies.
