However, there are ongoing research and clinical trials exploring the development of potential vaccines or immunotherapies for peanut allergy, with the goal of desensitizing the immune system to peanut allergens. These approaches aim to reduce the severity of allergic reactions or eliminate the allergic response altogether. Some experimental treatments involve administering small, controlled doses of peanut protein to gradually desensitize the immune system, while others focus on modifying the immune response through targeted immunotherapy. While promising, these approaches are still in the early stages of development and are not yet widely available for clinical use.",
