This chromatin is then fragmented and subjected to bisulfite treatment, which converts cytosines to uracils and preserves DNA methylation patterns. Next, specific methylated regions are captured using methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins. These captured regions are then amplified using a PCR-based approach.\n\nAfter amplification, the captured DNA fragments are sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology, generating data on gene expression and chromatin structure. This data can be analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes, DNA methylation patterns, and other epigenetic features.\n\nSLIC-CAGE is a valuable tool for researchers studying rare cell populations or working with limited amounts of starting material, as it allows for detailed analysis of chromatin structure and gene expression with very small sample sizes.
