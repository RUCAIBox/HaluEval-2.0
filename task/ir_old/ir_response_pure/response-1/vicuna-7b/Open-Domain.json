DeMayo was known for his intelligence and his ability to keep the peace among the various factions within the Kansas City criminal underworld. He was also known for his strict code of ethics, which prohibited the murder of innocent people or the use of violence against women. Despite his reputation as a fair and just leader, DeMayo was not above using violence to protect his interests or to punish those who crossed him.\nAnother name for the Kansas City crime family that Frank \"Chee-Chee\" DeMayo led is the Kansas City Mafia. This name is derived from the Italian-American Mafia, which had a significant presence in Kansas City during the early 20th century. However, the Kansas City Mafia was not a formal organization that was directly affiliated with the Italian-American Mafia. Instead, it was a collection of independent criminal groups that shared a common ethnic background and a similar way of doing business.\nIt is worth noting that the exact nature and structure of the Kansas City Mafia is not well documented, and there is much speculation and debate among historians and researchers about this topic. Some sources suggest that the Kansas City Mafia was a loose confederation of criminal groups that shared a common ethnic identity and a code of conduct, while others argue that it was a more formalized organization with a centralized leadership structure. Regardless of its exact nature, the Kansas City Mafia was a significant force in the criminal underworld of Kansas City during the 1920s and 1930s, and Frank \"Chee-Chee\" DeMayo was a key figure in its leadership."
