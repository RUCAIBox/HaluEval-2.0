However, they also have their own distinctive facial gestalt. Both syndromes have been found to be associated with mutations in the NSD1 gene, suggesting a potential genetic similarity between the two conditions. Therefore, based on the information provided, Weaver syndrome and Sotos syndrome share some similarities but also have their own distinct features and genetic associations."

Female rats showed greater and more rapid sensitization of locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior than males, and prior exposure to AMPH was associated with an elevation in resting striatal dihydroxyphenlacetic acid (DOPAC) to DA ratios in female, but not male rats. Additionally, males were more variable and heterogeneous in their response to repeated AMPH treatment, being divisible into two neurochemically distinct subgroups, while females were not. Therefore, there are indeed sex differences in SAMHD1 activity."

The PDZ domain is responsible for recruiting interacting partners of SATB1 to its genomic binding sites, thereby allowing SATB1 to repress its regulated genes. Sequestration of the interaction partners by the PDZ-like domain results in de-repression of SATB1-regulated genes, indicating that the PDZ-like domain exerts a dominant negative effect. Additionally, gene expression profiling revealed that overexpression of the PDZ-like domain led to upregulation of genes involved in important signalling cascades and cellular functions, demonstrating the role of the PDZ domain in global gene regulation through its interaction with other cellular proteins."
