This leads to the accumulation of mutations. The yeast mismatch-repair (MMR) system has been found to be involved in mutagenesis of stationary-phase cells. Deletions in genes encoding MutS- and MutL-related proteins have been shown to increase the reversion frequency of mutations, with the strongest effect observed in MSH2-deprived strain. Disruption of MSH3 or MSH6 genes resulted in elevation of mutation frequency and rate, but to a lesser degree than that caused by the inactivation of MSH2. MutL-related proteins, particularly Mlh1, also play a role in mutation avoidance in stationary-phase cells. These findings suggest that MMR proteins, particularly MutS homologues, are involved in the control of mutability in stationary-phase cells."
