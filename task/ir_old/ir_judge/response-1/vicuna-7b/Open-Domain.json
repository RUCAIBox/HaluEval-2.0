DeMayo was known for his intelligence and his ability to keep the peace among the various factions within the Kansas City criminal underworld. He was also known for his strict code of ethics, which prohibited the murder of innocent people or the use of violence against women. Despite his reputation as a fair and just leader, DeMayo was not above using violence to protect his interests or to punish those who crossed him.\nAnother name for the Kansas City crime family that Frank \"Chee-Chee\" DeMayo led is the Kansas City Mafia. This name is derived from the Italian-American Mafia, which had a significant presence in Kansas City during the early 20th century. However, the Kansas City Mafia was not a formal organization that was directly affiliated with the Italian-American Mafia. Instead, it was a collection of independent criminal groups that shared a common ethnic background and a similar way of doing business.\nIt is worth noting that the exact nature and structure of the Kansas City Mafia is not well documented, and there is much speculation and debate among historians and researchers about this topic. Some sources suggest that the Kansas City Mafia was a loose confederation of criminal groups that shared a common ethnic identity and a code of conduct, while others argue that it was a more formalized organization with a centralized leadership structure. Regardless of its exact nature, the Kansas City Mafia was a significant force in the criminal underworld of Kansas City during the 1920s and 1930s, and Frank \"Chee-Chee\" DeMayo was a key figure in its leadership.",

The documentary also explores the potential health risks associated with consuming genetically modified foods.\nDocument-1: Agee is a 1974 American documentary film directed by Philip Kaufman and written by Walon Green. The film is based on the book \"In the Midst of Plenty: A Report on the Great American Middle Class\" by James Agee and photographer Walker Evans. The book and film are a study of the lives of sharecroppers in Alabama during the Great Depression. The film is a poignant and powerful portrayal of the struggles of the working class in the United States, and it is considered a classic of American documentary filmmaking.\nIn summary, both \"The Future of Food\" and \"Agee\" are documentaries that explore different aspects of society and the human experience. \"The Future of Food\" focuses on the impact of genetically modified foods on the food industry and the health of consumers, while \"Agee\" is a poignant portrayal of the struggles of the working class in the United States during the Great Depression.",

The hotel was one of many in the area, including the Sheraton located just down the street at 91 Bay State Road, which would later be purchased by Boston University and converted into a dormitory. The Kenmore Square Hotel was known for its proximity to Fenway Park and was often patronized by visiting baseball clubs, including the Boston Red Sox. Babe Ruth, a frequent visitor to the hotel, had a particular fondness for suite 818 and made it his habit to request it whenever he stayed there. In 1933, Charles Newton took over as the hotel's manager and was able to turn it around from the effects of the Great Depression, making it a fashionable apartment hotel.",
