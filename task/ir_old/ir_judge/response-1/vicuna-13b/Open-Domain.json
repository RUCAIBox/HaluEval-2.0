Rhythm Corps formed in 1981 with Michael Persh, Greg Apro, Davey Holmbo (also known as David Adamson), and Richie Lovsin. As Rhythm Method, the band played in the local area and attracted a local following. The EP \"Pacquet De Cinq\" is their only release as Rhythm Method, but later runs of the EP called the band Rhythm Corps. They played shows with several notable bands, including The Replacements and The Bangles.\nOn the other hand, Bedhead was an alternative rock band from Austin, Texas that was active in the 1990s and 2000s. They released several EPs and full-length albums during their career. The band was known for their melodic and introspective sound, and their songs often featured complex guitar arrangements. Bedhead formed in 1992 with Andrew Huffstetter, Jim Suhler, and Rob Verhagen. They released several EPs and full-length albums before disbanding in 2003. The band has since reunited for occasional performances.\nIn summary, while Rhythm Corps was an alternative rock band from the 1980s that released two EPs and two full-length albums, it is not clear which band, Bedhead or Rhythm Corps, was known for having an actual number of EPs.",
