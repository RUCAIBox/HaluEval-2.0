UNKNOWN: Without specific scientific research or data provided, it is not possible to confirm or refute the statement about the association between ERAP1 SNPs and ankylosing spondylitis in HLA-B*40:01 carriers. This would require specialized knowledge of the genetics and immunology related to ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n3. TRUE: The statement is essentially a restatement of the first. The ERAP1 SNP rs30187 association with ankylosing spondylitis does indeed occur in individuals who do not carry the HLA-B*27 genotype, suggesting that there is an independent association.\n\n4. TRUE: There is scientific evidence supporting epistasis between ERAP1 SNPs and HLA alleles in the context of ankylosing spondylitis. Epistasis refers to a situation where the effect of one gene (in this case, ERAP1 SNPs) is dependent on the presence or absence of one or more 'modifier genes' (in this case, HLA alleles). The interplay between these genetic factors can influence the onset and severity of the disease.",
