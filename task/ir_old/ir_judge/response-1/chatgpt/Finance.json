However, if the plan document allows for a higher deferral percentage, then the total salary needed to defer $17,500 will be different.

Then, calculate your maximum housing cost, including the mortgage, homeowner’s insurance, PMI, association fees, and property taxes, which should not exceed 32 percent of your gross monthly income. Finally, calculate your maximum total debt service, which should not exceed 40 percent of your gross monthly income.\nYou can also use web-based tools offered by banks to run these numbers for a more accurate estimate. Remember to also consider factors such as interest rates, mortgage length, and how much you can afford to pull out of your savings.\nAdditionally, keep in mind the recommendation to put down at least 20% in cash to avoid PMI. It's also important to remember that buying a house is not always the best financial decision, especially if you don't plan to stay in the same place for at least five years. Renting may be a more cost-effective option, depending on the local housing market. Ultimately, make sure that buying a house makes sense financially and aligns with your lifestyle needs.",

TRUE: Financial experts often suggest that your total housing costs, including mortgage payment, homeowner's insurance, private mortgage insurance (PMI), association fees, and property taxes, should not exceed a certain percentage of your gross monthly income. This percentage is commonly set at around 30-32 percent and is referred to as the \"front-end ratio\" or \"housing expense ratio.\"\n\n3. TRUE: The \"back-end ratio\" or \"debt-to-income ratio\" is another guideline used by lenders to determine how much debt an individual can take on. It is recommended that your total monthly debt payments, which includes the housing costs as well as other debt payments like car loans and credit cards, should not exceed 36-43 percent of your gross monthly income. Saying that it should not exceed 40 percent fits within this commonly accepted range.\n\n4. TRUE: It is commonly recommended to make a 20 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home to avoid the requirement of paying for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).

One reason is to prevent employees from rapidly accumulating their full annual match amount in a few pay periods at the beginning of the year and then immediately leaving for employment elsewhere. This is a form of vesting, where you have to work for a certain amount of time to receive the full match. Additionally, spreading out contributions encourages employees to practice a sensible strategy of dollar cost averaging, which reduces the impact of volatility on earnings. It also helps manage the flow of investment into the mutual funds and can make plan administration fees more convenient for accounting purposes. Moreover, companies prefer to spread their profits and expenses evenly over the year, so creating a 401(k) system that supports this objective is beneficial for employers. Ultimately, the 401(k) matching funds serve as a way to manipulate employees into behaving in a way that is beneficial for both the employer and the employee's investment success.",
