This tool aims to achieve higher coverage and avoid getting stuck in either fuzz testing or symbolic execution. It also includes two key optimizations to improve the efficiency of full system testing. The effectiveness of Ffuzz was evaluated on real-world binary software and 844 memory corruption vulnerable programs in the Juliet test suite, showing that it can effectively and efficiently discover software bugs in the full system software stack.",
