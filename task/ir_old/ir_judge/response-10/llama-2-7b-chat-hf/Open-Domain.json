This is evident from the mention of the live album \"Album concerto\" released in 1979, which features songs performed in duet with Augusto Daolio and includes previously unreleased tracks such as \"Dio è morto\", \"Noi\", and \"Per fare un uomo\". The album's focus on cities with symbolic value, such as Byzantium, Venice, Bologna, and Milan, also suggests that the 1970s were a significant influence on the album's creation.",

However, based on the context of the information provided, it can be inferred that the museum is likely the Charleston Museum in Charleston, South Carolina.\nThe document mentions that the ship was built in 1942 by the Charleston Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. in Charleston, South Carolina, and launched on October 18, 1942. It also mentions that the ship was commissioned on April 21, 1943, with Lt. J. D. Garland in command. These details suggest that the ship was built and commissioned in Charleston, South Carolina, and therefore, it is likely that the museum where the ship is preserved is also located in Charleston.\nAdditionally, the document mentions that the ship served at Bermuda from June 17, 1943, to May 8, 1944, and returned to its duties at Bermuda until July 22, 1944. Bermuda is located in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of South Carolina, and it is possible that the ship is preserved at a museum in Charleston, South Carolina, as it is a convenient location for the ship to be displayed and preserved.\nIn conclusion, while the reporting mark of the museum where the Sumter & Choctaw 102 is preserved is not explicitly mentioned in the information provided, it can be inferred that the museum is likely the Charleston Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, based on the context of the information provided.",
