This highlights the complexity of time zone boundaries and the need for international cooperation to ensure accurate timekeeping. \nIn terms of whether there should be more or fewer time zones, it is a difficult question. On one hand, having more time zones could provide more localized and accurate timekeeping for regions with significant geographical differences. On the other hand, having fewer time zones could simplify international communication and travel. \nUltimately, the current system of time zones is based on a balance between these factors and the practical considerations of international borders and practicality.
