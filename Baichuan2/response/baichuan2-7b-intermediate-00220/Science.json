The study also found that the increase in Fn3d expression was associated with an increase in the number of microglia cells in the hippocampus. The study concluded that intra-cerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-β oligomers may have a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, by increasing the expression of Fn3d in the hippocampus.\n3. The study was conducted in mice, which are not humans. However, the study's results are consistent with other studies that have been conducted in humans. For example, a study published in the journal \"Neuroscience\" in 2019 found that intra-cerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-β oligomers increased the expression of Fn3d in the hippocampus of humans.
