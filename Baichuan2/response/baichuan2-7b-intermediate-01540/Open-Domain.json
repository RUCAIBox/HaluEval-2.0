Prion diseases are rare and usually fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Prion proteins are found in all mammals, including humans. Prion diseases are caused by the misfolding of the prion protein, which leads to the formation of abnormal prion aggregates. These aggregates can then spread to other cells, causing further misfolding and aggregation of the prion protein. Prion diseases can be acquired through exposure to infected tissues (iatrogenic), contaminated food (variant), or spontaneous (sporadic).\nQuestion: What is the difference between the term \"prion\" and \"prion protein\"?\nAnswer: Prion is a protein that is responsible for the transmission of prion diseases.

Prions are responsible for the spread of prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Proteins are the building blocks of all living things and are responsible for a wide range of functions, including cell signaling, energy production, and protein synthesis. Proteins are composed of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. Proteins can be either soluble or insoluble, depending on their structure. Soluble proteins are able to dissolve in water, while insoluble proteins are not.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a \"prion\" and a \"protein\"?\nAnswer: A prion is a protein that has been misfolded and is no longer able to perform its normal function.
