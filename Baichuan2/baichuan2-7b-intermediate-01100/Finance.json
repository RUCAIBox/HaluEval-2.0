This is because the employer may only match a portion of the employee's contributions, and if the employee makes all of their contributions at the beginning of the year, the employer may not be able to match all of the employee's contributions.\nSpreading the contributions throughout the year can also help the employee to save more money over time, as the employee will have more time to accumulate savings.

They can be used to hedge against risks, such as volatility, interest rate changes, or currency fluctuations.\n2. Derivatives can be used to hedge against risks by buying a derivative that is linked to the value of an underlying asset. For example, if a financial investor believes that the value of a stock will increase in the future, they can buy a call option on the stock, which gives them the right to buy the stock at a certain price for a certain period of time.

This type of investor typically does not actively manage their portfolio, but instead relies on the expertise of the investment manager to make decisions about which stocks or bonds to buy and sell.\nAn active investor, on the other hand, is one who actively manages their portfolio by making their own decisions about which stocks or bonds to buy and sell. This type of investor may also use other strategies, such as trading, to try to gain an advantage over the market.\nPassive investors typically have lower fees than active investors, as the investment manager is responsible for managing the portfolio. However, passive investors may also have lower returns than active investors, as the investment manager may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities that are not available to the general public.\nQuestion: What"
