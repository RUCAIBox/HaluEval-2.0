They drive much of the movement of ions, temperature, and other materials.\n2. If a concentration gradient helps explain water loss in plants, where do you think the concentration of water molecules is higher: in the air surrounding the plant or in the plant tissue? Why?\n3. The concentration of water molecules in the air surrounding the plant is higher than in the plant tissue. This is because the air is a gas, which means that the molecules are spread out and not packed together. This allows for more space between the molecules, which means that the water molecules can move more freely.\n4. The concentration of water molecules in the plant tissue is lower than in the air surrounding the plant.

The device consisted of a glass tube filled with mercury, which was connected to a glass tube filled with air. The mercury level in the glass tube filled with air was used to measure atmospheric pressure.\nPascal's barometer was an important tool for scientists and engineers of the time, as it allowed them to measure atmospheric pressure and understand how it changed with altitude.
