When writing these questions, it’s good to have a couple of those interests in mind so that if you get towed down a path that doesn’t necessarily mesh with what the group does or you started off in the wrong direction, you can steer yourself back on track.\nAs a follow up to this last point, if you also had a list of specific publications or projects a group was working on, it would be much easier to assert that you were interested in working with them specifically.\nEase of access to your application\nIf a potential voting member has to look for your application, they're likely going to glance over it and forget about it. The easier they can stumble across your application the better. In general, separate your name from the rest of your application so if it necessarily falls near the end (it upsets CS folks to see their department name at the bottom), a glance can immediately allow someone to see that they should look at your application time and again.\nLack of a CV\nAsking for a CV is not to say that everyone should have one. A resume can work just as well as a CV. This omission is more due to the fact that I have heard more than one time cases of people who continuously talked about their previous experiences in their Letters and/or Personal Statements, but never got around to linking their experience to a List of Publications. This confuses me profoundly. Why a student would believe they would be qualified to even consider the USTET Mellon Fellow position (staff member, teacher, mentor, and researcher on top of library research and leadership activities) when they cannot even be bothered to link their previous experience to a well crafted List of Publications of their previous research experiences says to me that they have no idea what kinds of skills USTET staff require. It says that they have no understanding of what you will be expected to do at this job. Then as important, their omission leads me to doubt that they have those previous experiences.\nFixed vs non fixed artifacts (Books vs. Journals)\nThere are a few things that come to mind thatICT and all the e-resources within have done to promote open access As we have increased our involvement, ICT has started to increase the way it works.

Demetrius will model using a large sheet of paper . next , students will cut along those lines and fold their cutout silhouette in half. then , transfer those measurements to a large piece of paper , tape the paper in place , and then ask the students to stand in the middle of the page . ask them to stretch out to hug their current measurement . their shadow will debate exactly where they should stand ; for now , they should try to stand still but face toward you so that you can clearly see their motionless form . people always extend a bit farther than they think they really do . after the students have marked their shadow , have them trace themselves with a pencil Jerry can show an example . then , as if they are taking of a shadow suit , walk off of the page , and trace your shadow again . this tracing will allow you to see exactly how much your actual bodily size is , and how much you extend when you hug yourself . think about how much extra space you would need if you were 10 times , 100 times , or 1000 times yourexemptedremittance size , and how far away you would have to be to extend to that size and make your shadow touch itself . after measuring lodgings for various cities and looking at how big they all are , students will ask Barak how big a sketch of the city would have to be in order to include every person who lived there . focus on the relationship between the map itself and its corresponding city .\nabout size measurement : you may have to adapt this lesson for students with Individual Education Plans ( IEP ) or Individual Health Plans ( IHP ) ( especially if the students are mobility -",

This ensures that the jellies can still survive even if there is less food available.\nThe main disadvantage of the varying reproductive habits of these organisms is that it can make them more susceptible to environmental changes.

    "text-davinci-002_response": "There is no definitive answer to this question as there are a variety of factors that can contribute to the intensity of both hurricanes and tornadoes. However, some generalities can be made. Hurricanes typically derive their intensity from a combination of wind speed, pressure, and rainfall. Tornadoes, on the other hand, are typically rated based on wind speed alone. This can lead to some deficiencies in tornado intensity ratings, as other factors (such as pressure and rainfall) can also contribute to a tornado's overall strength. Some possible solutions to this include taking these other factors into account when rating tornado intensity, or providing separate ratings for wind speed, pressure, and rainfall.",

Another argument in favor of nuclear power is that it can provide a reliable round-the-clock source of energy, which is not as easily achievable with renewable sources.
