    "llama-7b_response": "The other airplane involved in the 1993 Tehran mid-air collision was a Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). The Il-76 was carrying military equipment and personnel from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) when it collided with the Airbus A300 operated by Iran Air.\n\nThe accident occurred on July 3, 1993, when the two planes were flying at an altitude of around 37,000 feet. The Airbus A300 was on a flight from the Iranian capital of Tehran to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with 270 passengers and crew members on board. The Ilyushin Il-76 was on a flight from the city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran to the capital when it collided with the Airbus A300.\n\nThe impact of the collision caused the Airbus A300 to break apart and crash into the ground, killing all 290 people on board, including 66 children and 16 crew members. The Il-76 also crashed, killing all 27 IRGC personnel on board.\n\nThe accident was one of the deadliest in Iran's aviation history and sparked widespread outrage and mourning in the country. It also led to the grounding of Iran Air's entire fleet of Airbus A300s and the suspension of the airline's license to operate flights to the UAE.\n\nThe investigation into the accident found that the cause was a combination of human error and technical failures. The Iranian air traffic control center had failed to provide proper guidance to the two planes, and the pilots of both planes had made mistakes that contributed to the collision. The investigation also found that the Airbus A300's autopilot system had malfunctioned, which may have contributed to the crash.",
