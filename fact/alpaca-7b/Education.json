Cellulose-based fuels require expensive and specialized equipment to produce, and the cost of production needs to be lowered in order for the fuels to become more widely used. Additionally, cellulose-based fuels need to be blended with other fuels in order to be used in existing engines, which adds to the cost. Another obstacle is the availability of the raw materials needed to produce cellulose-based fuels. Not all areas have access to the necessary raw materials, which limits the availability of the fuels. Finally, cellulose-based fuels also face competition from other, more established fuels, such as fossil fuels, which are cheaper and more readily available.",

Chemical rocket engines are large and heavy due to the amount of fuel and oxidizer required to generate thrust. This makes them unsuitable for small, lightweight vehicles. Additionally, chemical rocket engines require complex and expensive fueling and ground support systems, which are impractical for small, unmanned vehicles. \nAnother issue is the thrust generated by the engine. Chemical rocket engines generate high thrust, but only for a short duration. This makes them unsuitable for long-term, continuous thrust applications, such as keeping a spacecraft in orbit. \nFinally, chemical rocket engines generate large amounts of heat and exhaust gas, which must be dissipated.
