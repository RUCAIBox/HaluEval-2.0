One of the most common applications of CRISPR-Cas9 is to knock out a gene by cutting both strands of DNA at the gene's location and then introducing a new piece of DNA to replace the old one. This can be done by targeting a site known to be bound by a protein called CTCF, which is involved in the formation of higher-order chromatin structures. By targeting these sites, the Cas9 protein can be guided to precisely cut both strands of DNA at the same location, thus knocking out the gene. However, this can also cause the genome to undergo changes in its topology, as the CTCF sites that were once bound by the protein are now disrupted, leading to rearrangements in the higher-order chromatin structure.",
