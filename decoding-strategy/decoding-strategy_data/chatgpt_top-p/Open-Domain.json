The worm was designed to spread across the early internet, infecting Unix machines and causing them to slow down or crash. It is estimated that the worm infected approximately 6,000 computers, which was a significant portion of the internet at the time.\nMorris was charged under the CFAA for causing damage to computers and for unauthorized access to government computers.

    "chatgpt_response": "The physician and biologist who became well-known for his work in a modernist movement in painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century, was Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. Roentgen is best known for his discovery of X-rays in 1895, for which he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.\nWhile Roentgen is primarily recognized for his groundbreaking work in the field of physics and medicine, he also had a keen interest in the arts and was an accomplished amateur painter. His scientific background and understanding of the human body likely influenced his artistic style, which was characterized by a focus on form, structure, and the interplay of light and shadow.\nRoentgen's paintings, which often depicted still lifes and landscapes, reflected the modernist aesthetic that was emerging in Germany at the time. Modernism in art sought to break away from traditional forms and explore new ways of representing the world, often through abstraction, experimentation with color and form, and a rejection of conventional techniques.\nWhile Roentgen's contributions to modernist painting may not be as widely recognized as his scientific achievements, they provide a fascinating insight into the multidimensional talents and interests of this pioneering figure. His work serves as a reminder that creativity and innovation can manifest in various forms, and that the boundaries between art and science are often more fluid than we might imagine."
