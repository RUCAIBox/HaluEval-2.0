The DESMOND program demonstrates a significant impact on biochemical outcomes.\nThe DESMOND program is a lifestyle intervention program for people with type 2 diabetes. It is a 12-month program that includes a 2-day residential program, 12 group sessions, and 12 individual sessions. The program is based on the principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy. The program is designed to help people with type 2 diabetes to make lifestyle changes that will improve their health and reduce their risk of developing complications.\nThe DESMOND program has been evaluated in a number of randomised controlled trials. The most recent trial was a randomised controlled trial of 120 people with type 2 diabetes. The trial compared the DESMOND program with usual care. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c at 12 months. The secondary outcomes were changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipids, and blood glucose.\nThe results of the trial showed that the DESMOND program was associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c at 12 months. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% in the DESMOND group and 8.3% in the usual care group. At 12 months, the mean HbA1c was 7.4% in the DESMOND group and 8.2% in the usual care group. The difference in HbA1c between the groups was 0.7% (95% CI 0.3% to 1.1%). The difference in HbA1c was statistically significant (p=0.001).\nThe results of the trial also showed that the DESMOND program was associated with a significant reduction in body weight.
