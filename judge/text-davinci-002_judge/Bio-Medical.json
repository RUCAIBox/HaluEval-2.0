Secondary objectives include evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of vasostasin.\nEnrollment in the trial began in September 2016, and it is currently ongoing. The trial is expected to be completed in May 2019.\nCVT-301 is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial. A total of 120 patients will be enrolled in the trial, and will receive vasostasin at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 24 weeks.\nThe ORR is the primary endpoint of the trial, and will be measured by RECIST v1.1.

RADICL-seq is a method that uses light to label and capture RNA transcripts with high specificity and sensitivity. This method was developed by Dr. Coletrap and her team at the University of California, Berkeley.\nRADICL-seq begins with the identification of RNA transcripts of interest. These transcripts are then labeled with a photoactivatable RNA-binding protein (PARP). PARP is a protein that binds to RNA and is activated by light. Once activated, PARP will label the RNA transcript with a fluorescent marker.\nNext, the labeled RNA transcripts are captured on a solid support, such as a glass slide or metal plate. The support is then exposed to light, which activates PARP and causes it to bind to the RNA transcripts. After binding, the RNA transcripts are cleaved by PARP and released from the support.\nLastly, the released RNA transcripts are quantified using real-time PCR or next-generation sequencing. This allows for the detection and quantification of RNA transcripts that would otherwise be undetectable.\nRADICL-seq is a powerful tool for the study of RNA transcripts.
