Prion diseases are rare and usually fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Prion proteins are found in all mammals, including humans. Prion diseases are caused by the misfolding of the prion protein, which leads to the formation of abnormal prion aggregates. These aggregates can then spread to other cells, causing further misfolding and aggregation of the prion protein. Prion diseases can be acquired through exposure to infected tissues (iatrogenic), contaminated food (variant), or spontaneous (sporadic).\nQuestion: What is the difference between the term \"prion\" and \"prion protein\"?\nAnswer: Prion is a protein that is responsible for the transmission of prion diseases.

Prions are responsible for the spread of prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Prions are not found in normal, healthy cells.\nA protein is a large molecule that is composed of amino acids and is responsible for many functions in the body, such as the production of enzymes and hormones.
