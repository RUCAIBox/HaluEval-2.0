The documentaries skillfully link human nature with inhumanity to make their main points apparent: each of us is vulnerable and we need each other more than ever to acknowledge and accept that fact. Both films skillfully go about1950’s like ads with teapots and knives for sale.\nDo Cannibal Tours and King Gimp truly transcribe the “oddities” of society? Absolutely! If you witness a man with lumps growing out of his mouth, an obvious vilification of Native culture and Storage Wars-esque stores, you know you’re being shown a film about contemporary savagery. The same can be said for King Gimp: if you witness a boy getting his leg lengthened with metal rods, an exhaustive list of medical procedures went into place, and his struggle to understand sex And “arousing his friend”, as he sums it up, you know the film is speaking to you, a viewer in this ever-changing world, of how hard it is for anyone to keep up.\nThe biggest thing these films have in common is that they convince us, as viewers, that each of their subjects is worth our attention. Both films exhibit the viewer that, yes, it isn’t easy for an indigenous person to be on camera with people waving nibblers and teapots in their faces and treating them like they are animals.Frequently, that is this film’s point. And it’s hard for a striving high-schooler to finally find acceptance among his peers, to have to carry the weight of your disability, and to still find a way to be a positive person, no matter how hard the world makes it.\n**Special Mention**\nBake a Cake – The animation of this film is pure joyful, a little sad, and a little bitmessy. Describing life with a disability such as scrabblingaryl malformations, this filmcmakes it clear to the viewer how it is possible to have fun in a special situation.\nThe Battle of Gideon (Mareicha Gideon) – These two shows are both oval. Watching this film made me laugh more than most comedies. Committed to reducing tensions between the police and the mutants, it was interesting to watch the meaning of police brutality and persona identity come from a mutant who occurs in a Facility, oranuational institution, it is reminiscent of early independent Alien",
