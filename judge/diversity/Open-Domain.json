To determine the distance between the two airports, we can use the distance formula:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\nWhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points. \n\nUsing the coordinates for Nome Airport and MidAmerica St. Louis Airport, we get:\n\n(x1, y1) = (53.3333, -156.6667) for Nome Airport\n(x2, y2) = (38.8889, -89.9999) for MidAmerica St. Louis Airport\n\nTherefore, the distance between Nome Airport and MidAmerica St. Louis Airport is:\n\nDistance = √((38.8889 - 53.3333)² + (89.9999 - -156.6667)²)\nDistance = √(11,666)\nDistance ≈ 3,333 miles\n\nBased on this calculation, MidAmerica St. Louis Airport is closer to its business district than Nome Airport, as the distance between the two airports is approximately 3,333 miles, while the distance between MidAmerica St. Louis Airport and its business district is likely to be much shorter.",
