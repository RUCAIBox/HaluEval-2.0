Generally, the two systems have similar mechanisms, however they each have distinct characteristics.\nCRISPR-Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1) is a Class 2 CRISPR system that is smaller and faster than its Class 1 counterpart, CRISPR-Cas9. It cuts DNA at a staggered point rather than a specific point, which increases precision. Furthermore, it has an indirect interface between the target DNA and effector RNAs, meaning that it does not require guide RNAs for successful cutting and editing.\nCRISPR-Cpf1, on the other hand, is a Class 2 CRISPR system that uses two RNAs and a single endonuclease to target and edit DNA. It has less off-target activity than its counterpart and is smaller in size, making it easier to deliver.

It modulates the release of histamine in the brain, which supports healthy wakefulness. Pitolisant reduces histamine levels and increases post-synaptic energy in the corpus striatum, decreasing sleepiness and increasing wakefulness. Additionally, pitolisant is hypothesized to reduce sleep latency, increase total wake time, and improve overall sleep quality. Pitolisant also has increased the activity of wake-related neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and noradrenaline. Finally, pitolisant has been shown to reduce sleep-related metabolic processes, which may further improve sleep quality.",
