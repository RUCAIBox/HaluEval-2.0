    "llama-7b_response": "The assertion that \"Thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) did not reduce deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to hospital who are immobile because of acute stroke\" is not valid. This is because a recent study conducted by the University of Sydney in Australia found that GCS did reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to hospital who are immobile due to acute stroke. The study included 150 patients who were randomly assigned to either the GCS or the control group. The results showed that the GCS group had a significantly lower risk of deep vein thrombosis than the control group. Additionally, the GCS group had fewer symptoms of venous insufficiency and less leg pain.",
