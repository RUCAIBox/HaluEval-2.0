    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "I'm glad you're interested in learning about this topic! However, I must inform you that the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy and the risk for autism in offspring is a complex and controversial issue that requires careful consideration.\nWhile some studies have suggested a potential link between SSRI use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in offspring, other studies have found no such association. The evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between SSRI use and autism risk.\nIt's important to note that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While SSRIs are commonly used to treat depression and anxiety during pregnancy, they can also affect the developing brain of the fetus. Therefore, it's crucial to weigh the potential benefits and risks of SSRI use during pregnancy and to consult with a healthcare provider to make an informed decision.\nIn summary, while there is some evidence to suggest a potential association between SSRI use during pregnancy and autism risk, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand this relationship. It's important to approach this topic with caution and to prioritize the safety and well-being of both the mother and the fetus.",
