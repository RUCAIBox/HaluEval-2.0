Phosphorylation of specific residues on substrate proteins by CK1 can regulate their activity, localization, or degradation. Here are some of the most common phosphorylation consensus motifs for CK1:\n1. S/T-X-X-X-R: This motif is found in many substrates of CK1 and represents the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by CK1. The X's represent any amino acid, and R represents the phosphate group.\n2. S/T-X-X-X-X-R: This motif is similar to the first one, but includes an additional residue at the beginning of the motif to create a more stable interaction with CK1.\n3. S/T-X-X-X-X-X-R: This motif is similar to the first two, but includes an additional residue at the end of the motif to create a more stable interaction with CK1.\n4. S/T-X-X-X-X-X-X-R: This motif is similar to the first three, but includes an additional residue at the end of the motif to create a more stable interaction with CK1.\nIt's important to note that these motifs are not specific to CK1 and may also be recognized by other protein kinases.

PyMOL: PyMOL is a popular molecular visualization tool that can be used to view and manipulate 3D molecular structures. It can also be used to visualize non-covalent contacts between molecules.\n2. VMD: VMD is another molecular visualization tool that can be used to view and manipulate 3D molecular structures. It can also be used to visualize non-covalent contacts between molecules.\n3. UCSF Chimera: UCSF Chimera is a powerful molecular visualization and analysis tool that can be used to view and manipulate 3D molecular structures. It can also be used to visualize non-covalent contacts between molecules.\n4. Jmol: Jmol is a Java-based molecular visualization tool that can be used to view and manipulate 3D molecular structures. It can also be used to visualize non-covalent contacts between molecules.\n5. PyMOL-like tools: There are several tools that are similar to PyMOL and can be used to visualize non-covalent contacts between molecules, such as ChimeraJS, MolScript, and PyMOL-like tools.\nThese tools can be useful for visualizing and analyzing non-covalent contacts between molecules, which can provide important information for understanding the behavior and interactions of molecules in a biological system.",
