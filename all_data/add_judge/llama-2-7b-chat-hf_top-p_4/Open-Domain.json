I'm happy to help you.\nThe recipes of one of the oldest beverages produced by humans, dating back to at least the 5th millennium BC in Iran, can be found in various types of ancient texts and artifacts. Some examples include:\n1. Cuneiform tablets: These are ancient clay tablets inscribed with wedge-shaped characters, used for writing in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq and parts of Syria, Turkey, and Iran). Some of these tablets contain recipes for beverages, including meads and wines, that date back to the 5th millennium BC.\n2. Hieroglyphics: These are ancient Egyptian writings that use pictures and symbols to represent words and ideas. Some hieroglyphics depict scenes of people harvesting and processing grains, which could include recipes for beverages made from these grains.\n3. Papyrus scrolls: These are ancient Egyptian writings that were made on long, thin strips of papyrus, a plant that grows in wet environments. Some of these scrolls contain recipes for beverages, including meads and wines, that date back to the 5th millennium BC.\n4. Other ancient texts: There are many other ancient texts from various cultures around the world that could potentially contain recipes for beverages dating back to the 5th millennium BC. These could include clay tablets from ancient Sumeria, stone inscriptions from ancient China, or other types of written records from ancient civilizations.\nIt's important to note that while these ancient texts may contain recipes for beverages, they may not be easy to decipher or understand without specialized knowledge and expertise.
