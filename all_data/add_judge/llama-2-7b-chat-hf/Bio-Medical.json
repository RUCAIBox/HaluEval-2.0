However, I must emphasize that the use of these antibodies is still in the experimental stage, and more research is needed to fully understand their safety and efficacy in humans.\nThat being said, here are some anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibodies that have been investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease:\n1. Aducanumab: This monoclonal antibody is designed to target beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Aducanumab has been studied in several clinical trials, including a phase 3 trial called ENGAGE, which showed that the drug did not slow cognitive decline in people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease.\n2. Gantenerumab: This monoclonal antibody is similar to aducanumab and has also been studied in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Gantenerumab has been shown to reduce beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, but its effect on cognitive decline is still unknown.\n3. AZD3293: This monoclonal antibody is being developed by AstraZeneca and has shown promise in reducing beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. AZD3293 is currently being studied in several clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n4.
