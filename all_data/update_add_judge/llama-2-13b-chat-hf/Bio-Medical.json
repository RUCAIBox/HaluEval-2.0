    "llama-2-13b-chat-hf_response": "Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. The Salzburg EEG criteria are a set of guidelines used to diagnose and classify seizure types based on electroencephalography (EEG) findings. These criteria are not used to diagnose any specific disorder, but rather to help clinicians identify and characterize seizure activity.\nIt's important to note that EEG findings are just one aspect of the diagnostic process, and a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's symptoms, medical history, and other diagnostic tests (such as imaging studies or blood work) is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis.\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask!",
