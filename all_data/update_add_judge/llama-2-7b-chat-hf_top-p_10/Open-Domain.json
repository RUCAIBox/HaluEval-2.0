    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Thank you for your question! The recipes of one of the oldest beverages produced by humans, dating back to at least the 5th millennium BC in Iran, can be found in various ancient texts and artifacts. Here are some examples:\n1. Cuneiform tablets: The oldest known recipes in the world are inscribed on cuneiform tablets dating back to around 2500 BC in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). These tablets include recipes for beer, wine, and other fermented beverages.\n2. Ancient Egyptian papyri: The Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating back to around 1600 BC, contains a recipe for a fermented beverage made from barley and dates. Other ancient Egyptian papyri, such as the Ebers Papyrus and the London Medical Papyrus, also contain recipes for various drinks.\n3. Avesta scripts: The Avesta is a collection of ancient Iranian sacred texts, including the Yasna and the Vendidad, which date back to the 5th century BC. While these texts do not specifically mention beverage recipes, they provide insights into the spiritual and cultural practices of ancient Iranians.\n4. Pompeii ancient writings: The ancient city of Pompeii, located in present-day Italy, was destroyed in 79 AD by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Before its destruction, Pompeii was home to a vibrant cultural and culinary scene, and some of its ancient writings include recipes for beverages such as wine and fruit drinks.\n5. Other historical sources: Other historical sources, such as the works of Herodotus and Ctesias, may also provide information about the beverages consumed in ancient Iran and other cultures.\nIt is important to note that these ancient texts may not provide detailed recipes or instructions for preparation, but they do offer valuable insights into the cultural and culinary practices of ancient societies. Additionally, some of these ancient beverages may still be enjoyed today, providing a window into the past and a connection to our cultural heritage.",

However, I must inform you that the concept of intentionally oversteering is not a recognized or official game in any driving competition, including the D1 Grand Prix.\nOversteering is a driving technique where the driver intentionally turns the steering wheel more than necessary to avoid losing control of the vehicle, which can lead to a skid or spin. While it can be a useful technique in certain situations, such as avoiding obstacles or regaining control of a skidding vehicle, it is not a deliberate or intentional maneuver in any form of racing or driving competition.\nTherefore, I cannot provide an official game or name for this technique, as it is not a recognized or approved driving technique in any professional or organized driving competition.
