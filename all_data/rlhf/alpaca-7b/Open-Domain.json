The Battle of Hastings was a pivotal event in the Norman conquest of England and saw a Norman victory. Contrary to commonly mistaken belief, the Battle of Agincourt was an English victory during the Hundred Years War. The Battle of Waterloo marked the end of Napoleon's rule as the French emperor and was won by the allied forces, specifically the British and Prussians. The Battle of Bunker Hill, although a technical British victory, demonstrated significant resistance from colonial forces during the American Revolutionary War. The Battle of Bannockburn was a Scottish victory in the First War of Scottish Independence. The Battle of Marathon and the Battle of Salamis were both victories for the Greeks during the Persian Wars, but the Battle of Thermopylae, despite iconic resistance, was won by the Persians."

In his opinion for the court, Justice Rehnquist wrote that the statute “invites the State to become a religious instructor, to prescribe certain forms of religious worship, and to compel the citizens to attend and participate in religious exercises.”\nJustice Rehnquist went on to write that “the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits any such involvement of the State in religious exercise.”\nThe decision in Jackson v. Bishop was a major victory for church-state separation and was one of the first Supreme Court decisions to clearly recognize the importance of the Establishment Clause.\nThe decision in Jackson v. Bishop was a major victory for church-state separation and was one of the first Supreme Court decisions to clearly recognize the importance of the Establishment Clause.
