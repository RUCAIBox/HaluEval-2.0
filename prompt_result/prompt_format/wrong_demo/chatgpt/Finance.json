    "chatgpt_response": "Refinancing before selling a property can be a good option for some individuals. It can help to secure a lower interest rate or adjust the loan terms, which can potentially increase the selling price or make the property more appealing to buyers. However, it is important to carefully consider the costs and potential savings associated with refinancing, as well as the timeframe and goals for selling the property. Consulting with a financial advisor or professional can provide a better understanding of whether refinancing is the right choice in a specific situation."

    "chatgpt_response": "The evidence for claiming that you cannot beat the market is primarily based on the efficient market hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that stock prices always incorporate and reflect all available information, making it impossible for investors to consistently outperform the overall market. Research studies have shown that actively managed funds, which aim to beat the market, often underperform passive index funds over the long term. Additionally, studies have also shown that a majority of individual investors fail to consistently beat the market. While some investors may have occasional successes, it is generally accepted that consistently beating the market is extremely challenging."
