The police attempted to disperse the crowd, and in the ensuing chaos, a bomb was thrown, killing several police officers and civilians.\nThe Haymarket Riot is significant because it marked a turning point in the labor movement in the United States.

    "vicuna-7b_response": "Happy Joe's is a chain of pizza restaurants based in Bettendorf, Iowa, while Bearno's is a chain of pizza restaurants based in Louisville, Kentucky. As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Happy Joe's had 10 locations, while Bearno's had 11 locations. However, it's important to note that the number of locations for both chains may have changed since then.\nIt's difficult to determine which chain is \"bigger\" as it depends on various factors such as the size of the locations, the number of locations in operation, and the geographic areas they serve. Additionally, there may be other factors that are not publicly available that could affect the comparison.\nIn any case, both Happy Joe's and Bearno's are regional pizza chains that have been serving their respective communities for many years. They both offer a variety of pizza options, including traditional and specialty pizzas, as well as other menu items such as salads, wings, and sandwiches.",
