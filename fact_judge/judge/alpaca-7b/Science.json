This procedure can be an effective way to reduce the burden of leukemia cells and allow the patient's own bone marrow to recover. \nIn addition, bone marrow transplantation can also help to reduce the risk of relapse, as the transplanted bone marrow is able to produce healthy blood cells and provide a lasting benefit.
