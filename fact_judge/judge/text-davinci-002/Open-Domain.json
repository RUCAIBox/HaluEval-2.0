The film follows Hoyt as he goes about his daily life, documenting his struggles and triumphs. While King Gimp does feel like a true documentary, there is an undeniable element of voyeurism to it.

Salinger agrees to help the group, but only if they agree to follow his rules. Among Salinger's rules are that the group must not go into the desert during the day, as the heat will kill them. The group must also not drink from any of the desert's water sources, as the water is poisonous. Finally, Salinger tells the group that they must not build any fires, as the smoke will attract the attention of the aliens who are living in the area. The group agrees to Salinger's rules and begins to follow them, but they quickly realize that the desert is a very dangerous place. They are constantly being attacked by the aliens, and they must also deal with the harsh conditions of the desert.

Another theory suggests that the balds are the result of human activity, specifically, the practice of \"laying by\" (cutting down all the trees in an area and then burning the slash).",
