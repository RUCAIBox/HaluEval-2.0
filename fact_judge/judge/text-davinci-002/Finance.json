    "text-davinci-002_response": "One way that Islamic Banking gives loans for housing purposes is by offering financing options that are based on the forbidden practice of riba, or lending with interest. In order to avoid riba, Islamic Banking offers products such as murabahah, or cost-plus financing, and ijara, or leasing. With murabahah, the bank and the borrower agree on a purchase price for the property being purchased and the bank finances the entire purchase. The borrower then makes installments to the bank over an agreed upon period of time, with the total amount paid back being slightly higher than the original purchase price due to the inclusion of a small profit for the bank. Ijara functions similarly to murabahah, except that rather than owning the property outright, the borrower is only leasing it from the bank and will make lease payments until the end of the lease period, at which point they will have the option to purchase the property or renew the lease.",

    "user_query": "Should I finance rental property or own outright?",
    "text-davinci-002_response": "There are a few things to consider when making the decision to finance rental property or own it outright. The first is the amount of money you have available for a down payment. If you have a large amount of money saved, you may be able to buy the property outright. If you do not have a lot of money saved, you may need to finance the property.\nThe second thing to consider is the interest rate on the loan. If you are able to get a low interest rate, it may be beneficial to finance the property. If the interest rate is high, it may be better to buy the property outright.\nThe third thing to consider is the length of the loan. If you are able to get a loan with a shorter term, you will have lower monthly payments. If you get a loan with a longer term, you will have higher monthly payments.\nThe fourth thing to consider is your credit score. If you have a good credit score, you may be able to get a lower interest rate. If you have a bad credit score, you may need to put down a larger down payment or get a co-signer.\nThe fifth thing to consider is the type of property you are buying. If you are buying a single-family home, you may be able to get a conventional mortgage. If you are buying a multi-family property, you may need to get a commercial mortgage.\nThe sixth thing to consider is the location of the property. If the property is in a good location, it may appreciate in value over time. If the property is in a bad location, it may decrease in value over time.\nThe seventh thing to consider is the condition of the property. If the property is in good condition, it may be easier to sell in the future. If the property is in bad condition, it may be difficult to sell in the future.\nThe eighth thing to consider is the amount of risk you are willing to take. If you are willing to take a lot of risk, you may be able to get a higher return on your investment. If you are not willing to take a lot of risk, you may need to get a lower return on your investment.\nThe ninth thing to consider is the taxes on the property. If the property is in a high tax bracket, you may have to pay more in taxes. If the property is in a low tax bracket, you may have to pay less in taxes.\nThe tenth thing",

Equity is the portion of your home's value that you own outright, free and clear of any liens or loans. So, if your home is worth $200,000 and you still owe $150,000 on your mortgage, then your equity is $50,000.\nNow, with that explanation out of the way, it's time to answer the original question. Are your parents ripping you off by not allowing you to build equity in your home? The answer is maybe.\nIf, during the time that you live in your parents' home, the value of the home increases, then you are not building any equity because you don't own the home. However, if the value of the home stays the same or decreases, then you are actually building equity because, even though you don't own the home, you are paying down the mortgage principal with each monthly payment, thus increasing your share of the home's value.\nSo, it really depends on what happens to the value of the home during the time that you live there.
