This is because KRAS is a gene that encodes a protein which is involved in the regulation of cell growth.

Osteocytes are the most abundant cell type in bone marrow and are responsible for the production of G-CSF, a cytokine that is essential for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). G-CSF binds to the receptor on the surface of HSPCs, which triggers a cascade of events leading to the mobilization of HSPCs from the bone marrow into the blood. This process is essential for the success of stem cell transplantation, making G-CSF an important therapeutic option for a variety of diseases. In addition, G-CSF has been shown to promote the engraftment of transplanted stem cells, suggesting that osteocytes are also important for the establishment of successful hematopoietic stem cell transplants.",

This is due to their ability to inhibit the expression of these mediators in the cells of the immune system. \nFurthermore, studies have shown that the blockade of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta can reduce inflammation and improve the symptoms of various diseases, such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
