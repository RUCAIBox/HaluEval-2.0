The video also features footage from Read's criminal career, including his time in prison and his various escapes.\nOverall, the music video for \"Chopper\" is a powerful and haunting portrayal of Read's life and his experiences as a criminal. It is a fitting tribute to a controversial and complex figure, and is well worth watching for anyone interested in the life and music of Mark \"Chopper\" Read.",

This is because the odds of each individual event in a regular parlay are multiplied together to determine the overall odds of the bet, whereas in a parlay which wagers on several events, the odds are combined in a more complex way that can make it more difficult to hit.\nHowever, it's important to note that the difficulty of hitting a parlay can also be affected by the specific events and the odds of each event. For example, if the events in a regular parlay have low odds, the difficulty of hitting the bet may be higher than if the events in a parlay which wagers on several events have low odds.\nIn summary, the difficulty of hitting a regular parlay versus a parlay which wagers on several events can vary depending on the specific events and the odds of each event.

The recovery from these diseases can be a complex and lengthy process, and the time it takes for an individual to recover can vary depending on the severity of the injury or disease, the type of treatment received, and the individual's overall health and well-being.\nIn the case of spinal cord injury, the recovery process can take months or even years, as the spinal cord has a limited ability to repair itself. The recovery may involve regaining sensation and movement in the affected limbs, and rehabilitation is often necessary to regain strength and mobility.\nIn the case of stroke, the recovery process can also be lengthy, as the brain has a limited ability to repair itself. The recovery may involve regaining the ability to speak, walk, and perform other daily activities. Rehabilitation is also often necessary to regain strength and mobility.\nIt's important to note that the recovery process is different for each individual, and some may experience more severe and prolonged symptoms than others. Additionally, the recovery process may also be influenced by factors such as age, overall health, and access to proper medical care and rehabilitation services.\nIn summary, the recovery from neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury and stroke can be a lengthy process, and the time it takes for an individual to recover can vary depending on the severity of the injury or disease, the type of treatment received, and the individual's overall health and well-being.",

However, it is important to note that the term \"documentary\" can encompass a wide range of styles and formats, and whether or not a film can be considered a \"true, bonafide documentary\" is subjective and can depend on the filmmaker's intentions and the accuracy of the information presented.\nKing Gimp, directed by Jim Lujan, is a film that explores the life of a man with a disability and his experiences as a member of a minority community. The film is a poignant and powerful portrayal of the struggles and triumphs of a marginalized group of people, and it is widely considered to be a documentary.\nCannibal Tours, directed by Ruggero Deodato, is a film that explores the cannibalistic practices of a tribe in the Amazon rainforest.

The film provides a glimpse into the lives of doctors and nurses working in the emergency room of the Al Kindi Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq during the height of the Iraq War. The film explores the challenges faced by the medical staff, including shortages of supplies, equipment, and security concerns, as they work to provide care to the injured and sick.\nSuper Size Me is a documentary film that was released in 2004 and directed by Morgan Spurlock. The film follows Spurlock's experiment in which he eats only McDonald's food for 30 days straight, and documents the effects of a diet consisting primarily of fast food on his health. The film raises awareness about the negative effects of a fast food diet on health and the food industry.\nIn summary, Baghdad ER and Super Size Me are two different documentaries with different subjects.",

He was the first to discover the electron, which he did in 1897 using a cathode ray tube.

Anne outlived all of Henry's other wives and died in 1557.\nAfter Henry's death, Anne was given a pension by his successor, Edward VI, and she lived a relatively quiet life in England. She was attended by Baroness Chandos, who was a close friend of Anne's and served as her lady-in-waiting.\nIt's worth noting that while Anne of Cleves was the fourth wife of Henry VIII, she was actually the third woman he married. Henry's first marriage was to Catherine of Aragon, who was his brother's wife and the mother of his only legitimate son, Prince Henry. Catherine was eventually divorced and replaced by Anne of Cleves. However, Henry's marriage to Anne was never consummated and he eventually married Catherine Howard, who was subsequently executed for adultery. Henry then married Catherine Parr, who outlived him and became the last of his wives.",

It was a significant departure from the Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game, as it was a more traditional fantasy role-playing game that focused on adventure and exploration in a medieval setting.\nIn AD&D Second Edition, players create characters by choosing a race, class, and abilities, and then embark on a quest to defeat a powerful villain or monster. The game uses a dice-rolling mechanic to determine the outcome of actions, and players must make strategic decisions about how to use their abilities and resources to overcome challenges.\nWhile both games were published by TSR, Inc., AD&D Second Edition was a much more complex and detailed game that was designed for experienced players who were looking for a more challenging and immersive role-playing experience.\nIn summary, the role-playing game that was published after Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game, which was AD&D Second Edition, was a more traditional fantasy role-playing game that focused on adventure and exploration in a medieval setting, while the Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game was a game that allowed players to create their own superheroes and engage in combat and adventure in a fictional city.",

The alpine tundra is a cold, high-altitude ecosystem that is found in mountain ranges around the world.\nThe alpine tundra is a fragile ecosystem that is influenced by harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures, limited soil nutrients, and intense solar radiation. The plants that grow in the alpine tundra are adapted to these conditions and are able to survive in the harsh environment.\nThe alpine tundra is home to a variety of plant species, including grasses, sedges, and low-growing shrubs. These plants are able to survive in the harsh conditions by having small leaves and stems that are able to conserve heat, and by having a deep root system that allows them to access limited soil nutrients.\nAnimals that live in the alpine tundra are also adapted to the harsh conditions. They include small mammals, such as lemmings and voles, as well as birds, such as ptarmigan and rock ptarmigan. These animals have thick fur or feathers that help to keep them warm, and they are able to survive in the harsh environment by migrating to lower elevations during the winter months.\nThe alpine tundra is an important ecosystem that plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle. It is a net sink for carbon, meaning that it absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it releases. This is due to the fact that the plants in the alpine tundra are able to photosynthesize efficiently in the low-light conditions found at high elevations.\nOverall, the alpine tundra is a unique and fragile ecosystem that is home to a variety of plant and animal species that are adapted to the harsh conditions found in this region.",

Covert was a 1957 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that a state law that allowed for the segregation of African American students in public schools was constitutional. The Court held that the state had the right to establish separate schools for African American students as long as the facilities provided were \"substantially equal\" to those provided for white students.\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña was a 2001 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government's use of race-based preferences and set-asides in contracting was unconstitutional.

It was a cultural and artistic movement that sought to break away from traditional forms and styles and to explore new ways of expressing ideas and emotions.\nThe modernist movement in literature, art, and architecture was characterized by a rejection of traditional forms and a focus on experimentation and innovation. In literature, modernist writers often used experimental techniques such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and symbolism to explore the inner lives of their characters.\nIn art, modernist artists sought to break away from traditional forms and styles and to create new, abstract forms that expressed the inner world of the artist. The most famous modernist artists include Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Henri Matisse, who developed the style of Cubism, and Wassily Kandinsky, who developed the style of abstract expressionism.\nIn architecture, modernist architects sought to create buildings that were functional, efficient, and expressive of the modern age. The most famous modernist architects include Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who developed the styles of Bauhaus, International Style, and Organic Architecture, respectively.\nAtlas Press has an extensive list of books that explore the modernist movement in literature, art, and architecture.

The pilots failed to notice the change and continued to fly the aircraft manually. The plane eventually crashed into the ocean, killing all 97 people on board.\nThe crash of Pan Am Flight 840 was a major factor in the development of modern flight safety systems, including the requirement for two pilots to be present in the cockpit at all times. It also led to the development of the \"sterile cockpit rule,\" which requires pilots to be in the cockpit during critical phases of flight, such as takeoff and landing.\nThe crash of Lufthansa Flight 540, which occurred on May 16, 1972, was also caused by an inadvertently disconnected autopilot. In that case, the autopilot was disconnected during a descent, and the pilots were unable to regain control of the aircraft before it crashed, killing all 117 people on board.",

The G20 is a group of 19 countries and the European Union, which together represent around 80% of the global population, 85% of global trade, and two-thirds of the world's GDP. The summit is held annually to discuss key economic and financial issues and to make policy decisions that affect the global economy.\nThe proposal to hold the G20 summit in Hamburg and Kiel was met with opposition from some residents of the two cities, who feared that the event would cause significant disruptions to their daily lives and lead to increased crime and violence. As a result, a referendum was held in which residents of Hamburg and Kiel were asked to vote on whether they supported the proposal to host the G20 summit in their cities.\nThe referendum was held on June 20, 2015, and the results showed that a majority of voters in Hamburg had rejected the proposal, with 51.6% of voters casting their ballots against the proposal and 48.4% in favor. In Kiel, the results were more evenly split, with 50.7% of voters casting their ballots against the proposal and 49.3% in favor.\nDespite the rejection of the proposal by the majority of voters in Hamburg, the G20 summit was ultimately held in Paris, France.

The reason for his dismissal was that he had become a vocal critic of the Nazi regime and had attempted to undermine the regime's foreign policy.\nOster was a career military intelligence officer who had served in various capacities throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He was known for his independence and his willingness to speak out against the regime when he believed it was necessary. In the late 1930s, Oster became increasingly concerned about the direction that the Nazi regime was taking Germany, and he began to work with other military officers to try to undermine the regime's foreign policy.\nIn 1938, Oster and a group of other military officers attempted to stage a coup against the regime. The coup, known as the Oster Conspiracy, was unsuccessful, and Oster was dismissed from his post as the head of the Abwehr. He was subsequently arrested and imprisoned, and he died in prison in 1943.\nThe dismissal of Oster from his post was part of a larger purge of military officers who were seen as being disloyal to the Nazi regime.

This means that the bank generates revenue from the services it provides to its customers, and the profits generated are then distributed among the bank's shareholders, including its members.\nIn most cases, the members of a bank are its shareholders, who own a portion of the bank and have a claim on its assets and profits. The amount of profits that each member receives is typically determined by the bank's board of directors, who take into account factors such as the bank's financial performance, the amount of capital it has available, and the needs of its shareholders.\nIt is worth noting that the specifics of how profits are distributed among members can vary from bank to bank, and some banks may have different types of members with different rights and obligations. For example, some banks may have retail shareholders who own a small number of shares, while others may have institutional investors who own a larger number of shares.\nOverall, the members of a bank derive their right to profits through their customer relationship with the bank, but the specifics of how profits are distributed can vary depending on the bank's structure and the needs of its shareholders.",

The fires were some of the worst in South Australian history, resulting in the deaths of 12 people and the destruction of over 100 homes.\nThe estimated cost of the damage caused by the Ash Wednesday fires in the Mount Barker area is difficult to determine with certainty, as many of the records from the time have been lost or destroyed. However, it is estimated that the total cost of the damage caused by the fires in South Australia was around AUD 100 million, with the majority of the damage occurring in the Mount Barker area.\nThe fires were caused by a combination of dry conditions, strong winds, and a severe heatwave, which created extremely dangerous fire conditions throughout the state. The fires burned for several days, and were only contained after heavy rain fell in the area.\nThe impact of the Ash Wednesday fires on the Mount Barker area was significant, with many homes and businesses destroyed, and the town's infrastructure severely damaged. The community was left to rebuild in the aftermath of the disaster, and the memory of the fires remains a significant part of the area's history.",

The attack, which was carried out by a right-wing extremist, resulted in the death of 77 people and injured many more.\nThe Oslo Process on Conflict Sensitivity is a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to promote the consideration of conflict sensitivity in the design, implementation, and evaluation of peacebuilding and development programs. The initiative was launched in 2012 and is led by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in collaboration with a range of international organizations, civil society groups, and governments.\nThe Oslo Process is based on the recognition that many peacebuilding and development programs can unintentionally exacerbate conflicts or contribute to their escalation. By promoting conflict sensitivity, the initiative seeks to ensure that these programs are designed and implemented in a way that takes into account the interests, needs, and concerns of all parties to a conflict, and that minimizes the risk of negative outcomes.\nThe Oslo Process has three main components: (1) the development of a set of guidelines for conflict sensitivity; (2) the establishment of a network of practitioners and experts who can share knowledge and best practices on conflict sensitivity; and (3) the promotion of the use of conflict sensitivity in peacebuilding and development programs around the world.\nOverall, the Oslo Process on Conflict Sensitivity is an important initiative that seeks to ensure that peacebuilding and development programs are designed and implemented in a way that promotes peace, stability, and sustainable development, rather than contributing to conflict and instability.",

However, they were also heavily influenced by the ideas of Manifest Destiny, which held that the United States had a God-given right to expand its territory across the North American continent.\nAs a result, the Peace Party believed that the Native American tribes should be forced to move to reservations, and they saw the attacks on Black Kettle's camp as a necessary step in achieving this goal. The attack on Black Kettle's camp was a brutal one, and it resulted in the deaths of many of the Native American men, women, and children who were present.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the United States government launched an investigation into the incident, but it ultimately concluded that the attack was justified because the Native Americans had been attacking white settlers in the region.
