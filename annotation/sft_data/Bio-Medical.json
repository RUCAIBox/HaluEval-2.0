PrP (prion protein) is a normal cellular protein found in mammals, including humans. However, misfolding of the PrP protein can lead to prion diseases, which are rare and usually fatal neurodegenerative disorders. The most well-known prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD can occur spontaneously (sporadic), be hereditary (familial), or acquired through exposure to infected tissues (iatrogenic) or contaminated food (variant). \nAccording to the UK National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU), the annual incidence of sporadic CJD in the UK is approximately 1 to 2 cases per million population. The prevalence of other forms of prion diseases, such as variant CJD, is lower. Variant CJD has been associated with the consumption of meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as \"mad cow disease.\"\nIt is important to consult official sources, such as scientific literature or reputable health organizations, for the most up-to-date and accurate information on prion diseases and related statistics.\n\nQuestion: Has the proteome of mice hippocampus been analysed?\nAnswer: "

CJD can occur spontaneously (sporadic), be hereditary (familial), or acquired through exposure to infected tissues (iatrogenic) or contaminated food (variant). \nAccording to the UK National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU), the annual incidence of sporadic CJD in the UK is approximately 1 to 2 cases per million population. The prevalence of other forms of prion diseases, such as variant CJD, is lower. Variant CJD has been associated with the consumption of meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as \"mad cow disease.\"\nIt is important to consult official sources, such as scientific literature or reputable health organizations, for the most up-to-date and accurate information on prion diseases and related statistics.\n\nQuestion: What are there sex differences in SAMHD1 activity?\nAnswer: "
