He had initially expressed reservations about the agreement and had called for additional sanctions on Iran, but he ultimately voted in favor of the deal in 2015. However, he faced significant pressure from opponents of the deal, including many Republicans and some Democrats, who argued that the agreement was too lenient on Iran and could lead to the country developing nuclear weapons.\nMenendez ultimately voted against a resolution to disapprove the JCPOA, which failed in the Senate by a vote of 42-58. However, his vote was seen as a setback for supporters of the deal, and the Stop Iran Rally was one of several events that took place in the months leading up to the vote to try to sway his opinion."
