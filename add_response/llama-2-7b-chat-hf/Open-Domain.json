I'm happy to help you.\nThe recipes of one of the oldest beverages produced by humans, dating back to at least the 5th millennium BC in Iran, can be found in various types of ancient texts and artifacts. Some examples include:\n1. Cuneiform tablets: These are ancient clay tablets inscribed with wedge-shaped characters, used for writing in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq and parts of Syria, Turkey, and Iran). Some of these tablets contain recipes for beverages, including meads and wines, that date back to the 5th millennium BC.\n2. Hieroglyphics: These are ancient Egyptian writings that use pictures and symbols to represent words and ideas. Some hieroglyphics depict scenes of beverage production and consumption, including the use of fermented drinks.\n3. Papyrus scrolls: These are ancient Egyptian writings on long, narrow strips of papyrus, often used for literary and administrative texts. Some papyrus scrolls contain recipes for beverages, including meads and wines, that date back to the 5th millennium BC.\n4. Ancient cookbooks: There are several ancient cookbooks that contain recipes for beverages, including meads and wines, that date back to the 5th millennium BC. Examples include the \"Ebers Papyrus\" and the \"Rhind Papyrus,\" both of which are ancient Egyptian medical texts that contain recipes for beverages.\nIt's important to note that the recipes found in these ancient texts may not be exact replicas of the original recipes, as they may have been passed down through generations and modified over time. However, they can provide valuable insights into the history and evolution of beverage production.\nI hope this information is helpful! If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask."

Hodges is a 2015 Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the United States. The case was based on the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, which guarantee the right to marry for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\nOn the other hand, the Slaughter-House Cases (1873) is a Supreme Court case that involved the constitutionality of a Louisiana law that regulated the slaughter of livestock. The case ultimately held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not protect the rights of African Americans to engage in certain occupations, including the slaughter of livestock.\nSo, to answer your question directly, neither Obergefell v.
