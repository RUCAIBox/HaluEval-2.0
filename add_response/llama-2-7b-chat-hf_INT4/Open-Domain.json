    "llama-2-7b-chat-hf_response": "Thank you for your question! I'm happy to help. However, I must inform you that the question you've asked is not factually coherent. The Genetic Medicine Institute is named after Dr. James Watson, not Joshua T. Mendell. Dr. Watson is a renowned geneticist and molecular biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for his groundbreaking work on the structure of DNA.\nI understand that you may have misspelled the name of the faculty member you were referring to, but I hope this clarification helps. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!"
