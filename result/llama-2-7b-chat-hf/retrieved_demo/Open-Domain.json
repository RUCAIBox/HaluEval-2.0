Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

        "query": "Compare the two poems with respect to their literary devices.\nPoem 1:\n\nI hear America singing, the varied carols I hear;\nThose of mechanics — each one singing his, as it should be, blithe and strong;\nThe carpenter singing his, as he measures his plank or beam,\nThe mason singing his, as he makes ready for work, or leaves off at the noon hour;\n\nPoem 2:\n\nAs I walked the boroughs of the bell-ringing city,\nI marked where on the gilded spire floated, high above\nThe bells, a thousand shaken voices\nOf silent people wreathing in the silent air.",
        "response": "Poem 1 and Poem 2 both utilize a variety of literary devices, but they do so in different ways.\n\nIn Poem 1, the primary literary device used is personification. The poet personifies America as a singing entity, and each profession (mechanics, carpenters, masons) as individual singers. This gives the poem a sense of unity and harmony, as if all parts of America are contributing to a single, joyful song. The use of repetition (\"singing his\") also emphasizes this unity and harmony. The poem also uses imagery, particularly auditory imagery, to create a vivid picture of the singing America. The poet describes the sounds of the different professions, creating a rich, layered soundscape that reflects the diversity and vibrancy of America.\n\nIn Poem 2, the primary literary device used is metaphor. The poet describes the city as a \"borough of the bell-ringing city,\" and the people as \"a thousand shaken voices.\" These metaphors create a sense of the city as a living, breathing entity, full of sound and movement. The poet also uses imagery, particularly visual and auditory imagery, to create a vivid picture of the city. The poet describes the \"gilded spire\" and the \"silent people wreathing in the silent air,\" creating a sense of the city's grandeur and the quiet, unseen lives of its inhabitants.\n\nBoth poems also use enjambment, where one line runs into the next without a grammatical break, to create a sense of flow and continuity. However, Poem 1 uses enjambment to create a sense of unity and harmony, while Poem 2 uses it to create a sense of movement and dynamism.\n\nIn conclusion, while both poems use similar literary devices, they do so in different ways to create different effects. Poem 1 uses personification, repetition, and auditory imagery to create a sense of unity and harmony, while Poem 2 uses metaphor, visual and auditory imagery, and enjambment to create a sense of movement and dynamism."

It is classified under its own division, the Ginkgophyta, and is known for its distinctive fan-shaped leaves which turn a bright yellow in the fall season. Ginkgo trees are dioecious, meaning that there are separate male and female plants. The species is very ancient, with a history that traces back over 200 million years, and it is often referred to as a living fossil since it has survived with little change since the time of the dinosaurs. Ginkgos are highly valued for their ornamental and symbolic significance as well as for their reputed medicinal properties. Extracts from ginkgo leaves have been used in traditional medicine and are sold as dietary supplements with claims to improve cognitive function, although scientific evidence for such benefits is mixed.\n\nPentas, known as Pentas lanceolata, is a genus of plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are commonly referred to as Egyptian stars due to the star-shaped flowers they produce, which come in shades of pink, red, white, and purple. Pentas are appreciated for their ability to attract butterflies and hummingbirds, making them a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions. They are used as ornamental plants, thriving in sunny conditions, and requiring a moderate amount of water.\n\nIn summary, Ginkgo biloba and Pentas are both plant species, but they belong to different families and have distinct characteristics and uses. Ginkgo biloba is an ancient tree species with medicinal uses, while Pentas is a flowering plant popular for its ornamental value and attractiveness to wildlife."

Pentas species are native to much of Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula but are grown as perennial garden plants in warmer climates and as annuals in regions with cold winters.\n\nIn summary, while they are both plants, Ginkgo biloba is a singular species with a long history and is well-regarded for its distinctiveness and longevity, while Pentas represents a genus of flowering plants appreciated largely for their ornamental value and ecological role in attracting wildlife."

It is based on the book of the same name by Alexander P. de Seversky. This film is notable for its time as it was created during World War II and argued for the significant use of air power in wars. It combined live-action footage with animation and was an unusual project for Disney, as it was an attempt to influence American policy and public opinion regarding the war effort. It attempted to sell the idea of strategic bombing as the key to victory.\n\n\"Portrait of Gina\" is a documentary and a lost film that Orson Welles shot in 1957, featuring Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida. Welles never completed the film, and the footage was presumed lost for many years. During the 1950s, Welles was fascinated by the cinema verite-style documentaries and planned this project to be a combination of an interview with the actress along with footage showing the other side of her life and fame. The film was intended to be an examination of the nature of stardom and Lollobrigida's place in it. However, due to various complications, the film was not finished or distributed as intended. Welles' films often had complex production histories, and \"Portrait of Gina\" is no exception.\n\nBoth films are examples of documentary film making and reflect the versatility of film as a medium for conveying different types of messages, be it wartime propaganda or the exploration of celebrity culture."

McGoldrick became involved with the company after it was founded in 1984 by Christopher Ryan, Liam Lonergan (owner of Irish travel agent Club Travel), and Tony Ryan (founder of Guinness Peat Aviation). \n\nRyanair was established with a vision of making air travel accessible for the masses at a low cost, a revolutionary concept for the time. P. J. McGoldrick, who later became the CEO of Ryanair, played a significant role in advancing this vision.\n\nUnder McGoldrick's leadership, Ryanair adopted many of the principles from Southwest Airlines, a successful low-cost carrier in the United States. This involved focusing on secondary airports to reduce landing fees, offering single class, no-frills service, rapid turnaround times, and operating a single type of aircraft to reduce maintenance costs.\n\nThe adoption of these and other cost-saving measures enabled Ryanair to offer incredibly low fares and stimulated market demand among fare-conscious leisure and business travelers, particularly within the European Union after the deregulation of the air industry. As a result, Ryanair experienced substantial growth and became one of the largest airlines in Europe by passenger numbers and a well-known example of a successful low-cost business model in the aviation sector."

While Robin Williams is indeed a versatile actor with a wealth of roles under his belt, he is not primarily known for the role of Josh Levison. It appears that Sam Huntington was not a lead star in \"Flubber,\" as he would have been relatively young in 1997 and not widely recognized yet.

It's a small genus that is native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It comprises a very limited number of species; information suggests that there is only one recognized species, Laccospadix australasica, commonly known as the Atherton palm.\n\nProsopis, on the other hand, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, which is in the pea family, subfamily Mimosoideae. This genus is much larger than Laccospadix and includes shrubs and trees commonly referred to as mesquites. They are found in subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Western Asia, and South Asia. There are about 44 accepted species of Prosopis.\n\nTherefore, based on the numbers from the respective genera, Prosopis has a significantly higher number of species compared to Laccospadix, which is known to have just one formally recognized species. Keep in mind that the exact number of species can sometimes change with new taxonomic discoveries and revisions."

Members of this genus are mostly deciduous, although some species in warmer climates may be evergreen. Prunus encompasses many species such as cherries (Prunus avium), plums (Prunus domestica), apricots (Prunus armeniaca), almonds (Prunus dulcis), and peaches (Prunus persica). These plants are typically characterized by having a smooth bark, lanceolate leaves, and flowers that are often showy with five petals. The fruits from Prunus species are commonly known as stone fruits or drupes due to their single large seed encased in a hard endocarp.\n\nTetrapanax, on the other hand, is a genus in the family Araliaceae, known for its large leaves and pithy stems. It has fewer species compared to Prunus, with Tetrapanax papyrifer (also known as the rice-paper plant) being the most widely recognized. Native to Taiwan and southern China, Tetrapanax is a small genus of woody plants that can grow as shrubs or small trees and are known for their broad, palmate leaves and the ability to spread by suckers, forming thickets.\n\nIn summary, while Prunus and Tetrapanax are from different plant families and have different uses, appearances, and growing habits, they are both woody plants, which makes it their common characteristic."

Orchidaceae is a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants with blooms that are often colorful and fragrant. This family is a large one, comprising more than 25,000 species spread across 880 genera.\n\nOn the other hand, Origanum belongs to the Lamiaceae family, also known as the mint family. Origanum is known for genus that includes various species of culinary herbs, the most well-known being Oregano, which is commonly used in Mediterranean, Turkish, and Latin American cuisines. The Lamiaceae family is characterized by aromatic plants that often have square stems and are found in temperate regions. This family includes well-known herbs such as mint, basil, thyme, sage, and rosemary, which are frequently used for culinary, medicinal, and ornamental purposes.\n\nIn short, Coelia (orchids) and Origanum (including oregano and other herbs) belong to two distinct plant families, Orchidaceae and Lamiaceae, respectively."

Offa was the King of Mercia, one of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in what is now England, during the 8th century. His reign lasted from 757 until his death in July 796. Eadburh's marriage to Beorhtric, which took place around 789, was part of a political alliance between the two kingdoms. Beorhtric became the King of Wessex after Offa purportedly used his influence to help him secure the throne over Egbert, who was also a claimant.\n\nThe marriage, however, did not result in a lasting alliance, and Eadburh developed a notorious reputation. She is said to have used her position to settle scores and allegedly poisoned those who opposed her or whom she disliked. According to Asser's 'Life of King Alfred,' Eadburh supposedly tried to poison someone in Beorhtric's court who had fallen out of her favor. Unfortunately, Beorhtric himself accidentally consumed the poison and died as a result. After Beorhtric's death, Eadburh was forced to flee to the court of Charlemagne. The marriage between Beorhtric and Eadburh thus did not provide long-term stability or unity in the relations between Mercia and Wessex."

However, considering his most prominent playing stint was with Sheffield United during the 1990s and assuming you are referring to teammates from that era, I can highlight a few notable accomplishments from players who would have been his teammates around that time.\n\nAt Sheffield United, Holland played alongside individuals such as Brian Deane and Alan Cork. Brian Deane, for instance, achieved the distinction of scoring the first-ever goal in the Premier League era in 1992. He went on to have a successful career at clubs like Leeds United and Benfica, and also earned caps for the English national team.\n\nPlayers like Tony Agana and Carl Bradshaw, who also played for Sheffield United during Holland's tenure, were part of the team that won promotions and had successful FA Cup runs. Although not superstar names in global football, these players made significant contributions at the domestic level, helping the club remain competitive in England's top tiers throughout the early 1990s.\n\nIf Paul Holland's English teammates from other clubs he played for or managed are considered, the list would include achievements ranging from promotions to higher leagues with their respective clubs, to personal accolades such as Player of the Year awards, or perhaps being capped for national representation at various levels of English football.\n\nWithout specifics on which teammates or which period of Holland's career you are interested in, it's challenging to provide a more precise list of accomplishments, but the general sense is that his English teammates would have notched several promotion wins, cup victories, individual awards, and some would have been selected to represent England at various levels."

The Xeric Foundation was established by Peter A. Laird in 1992, but this information does not provide insight into Philip E. Ryan's date of birth.\n\nSince private individuals often keep their personal data, such as birth dates, out of public records, it can be challenging to find this information unless it has been voluntarily disclosed. Therefore, without a known public record or self-disclosure from Philip E. Ryan himself, his date of birth remains private.\n\nThe Xeric Foundation itself is known for its support to comic book creators and for offering grants for self-publishing to new and upcoming artists. Over the years, the foundation has shifted its focus from assisting comic book creators to funding environmental causes. However, none of the information publicly shared by the foundation includes specific personal details about the founder's birth date."

        "response": "\"My Western Home\" is a poem that later evolved into the famous American folk song known as \"Home on the Range.\" The original poem was written by Dr. Brewster M. Higley VI who was living in Smith County, Kansas when he penned the verses in the early 1870s. Higley, a homesteader originally from Indiana, wrote the poem to express his love for the prairie and it was eventually set to music by his friend Daniel E. Kelley. \n\nWhile not a town but rather a rural community, Higley's homestead was situated near the town of Athol, Kansas, which is in Smith County. At the time Higley wrote \"My Western Home,\" late 19th-century Smith County was a sparsely populated part of the American frontier, and his inspiration for the poem came from this expansive and undisturbed prairie surrounding him. It became the Kansas state song in the 1940s and remains an iconic symbol of the American West."

The Dandy Warhols formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1994 and have been known for their blend of alternative rock with psychedelic pop influences.\n\nThe band likely chose the name as a playful homage to Warhol's huge influence on pop culture and art, as well as the band's own interest in these themes as they relate to music. The name is a pun, playing on the similarity between 'dandy', a term for a man excessively concerned with his appearance and refinement, and 'Andy', the artist's first name."

Released in 1990, \"Dreams\" is a departure from the Shakespearean themes of \"Ran,\" and instead is a collection of eight vignettes, each one based on actual dreams that Kurosawa claimed to have had repeatedly.\n\n\"Dreams\" is an anthology film that blends elements of fantasy, drama, and magical realism. The segments hinge on environmental, spiritual, and personal themes, presenting various stories that range from a boy's encounter with traditional Japanese spirits and folklore creatures to a reflection on the aftermath of nuclear war. The film is rich with visual symbolism and offers a deeply personal glimpse into Kurosawa's psyche and concerns for humanity and the natural world. It features stunning visuals and is known for its strong environmental message, particularly in the segments that deal directly with the consequences of human disregard for nature.\n\nOne of the most famous vignettes within \"Dreams\" is \"The Peach Orchard,\" wherein a young boy witnesses the spirits of peach trees, angered by the cutting down of their orchard. Another notable segment, \"Crows,\" stars director Martin Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh, and it explores the imaginative world, creativity, and turbulent mindset of the artist.\n\n\"Dreams\" was met with a great deal of respect from cinematic communities around the world, both as a potent thematic exploration and as an example of Kurosawa’s enduring ability to craft visually compelling films. The techniques and artistry employed in \"Dreams\" are consistent with Kurosawa’s reputation for meticulous detail, dynamic composition, and rich storytelling."

This game requires minimal physical components - just a dictionary, paper, and pens - and the rules are simple to understand. It's a game that can be easily played on a small table and doesn't require a lot of setup or cleanup.\n\nYINSH, on the other hand, is a strategy board game that is part of the GIPF project. It involves moving rings and discs on a hexagonal board to form lines of a certain color. The game requires a larger surface area to set up the board and pieces, and the rules are more complex than Fictionary. \n\nIn conclusion, if we consider the setup, space required, and complexity of rules, Fictionary would generally be easier to play on a tabletop than YINSH.

It originated in the 1940s and is often associated with Polynesian-style settings and tiki bars.\n\nOn the other hand, the term \"Sour\" refers to a family of cocktails made with a base liquor (commonly whiskey, amaretto, or pisco), lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener such as simple syrup. The drink is usually shaken with ice and strained then garnished with a slice of citrus fruit or a maraschino cherry. A well-known member of the sour family is the Whiskey Sour.\n\nBoth drinks are served in various settings, including casual dining, upscale bars, and social gatherings where cocktails are a common element. They are enjoyed for their balance of sour, sweet, and strong flavors, and while they are liquid and consumable just like food, they do not provide significant nutritional value and are not classified as food items."

        "query": "Which is endemic to farther north, Angophora or Luculia?",
        "response": "Angophora and Luculia are two different genera of flowering plants, and they have different natural distributions.\n\nAngophora is a genus of trees or large shrubs in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, and is closely related to the eucalypts. Angophora species are native to Australia, where they are found predominantly in the eastern parts of the continent, including New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. Although endemic to Australia, these species are not typically found in the far northern regions but are more common in the temperate zone further south.\n\nLuculia is a genus in the family Rubiaceae and comprises a small number of shrub species known for their fragrant flowers. Luculia species are native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia, including countries like Nepal, Bhutan, India, Thailand, and Vietnam. Luculia prefers cooler, mountainous regions, which can include areas that are farther north but not necessarily colder than the habitat of Angophora, given that Luculia's range is centered around Asia's more temperate and subtropical mountainous regions.\n\nSo, if we interpret \"farther north\" in terms of global distribution relative to the equator, Luculia is endemic to regions that are generally farther north compared to Angophora, given that Angophora is restricted to Australia and does not extend into Southeast Asia or the Himalayas. However, it's essential to recognize that both are endemic to different continents and have adapted to distinct climatic and geographical conditions."

Meanwhile, Suzhou is a renowned city in Jiangsu Province, and Shengzhou is a county-level city within the prefecture-level city of Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province.\n\nWhen considering \"city level,\" if we assume you mean administrative ranking or status in China's political hierarchy, then Suzhou typically has a higher status. Suzhou is a prefecture-level city, which is a high level of city classification just below the provincial level. As a prefecture-level city, Suzhou has jurisdiction over several districts and county-level cities, and it is a significant economic and cultural center with a long history and substantial autonomy in local governance.\n\nShengzhou, as a county-level city, is one administrative level below Suzhou, as it is part of the prefecture-level city of Shaoxing and has less autonomy than Suzhou. It governs over several towns and townships.\n\nTo clarify, in summary:\n\n- Anhui is a province, larger than any city and a higher level of administration in the Chinese system.\n- Suzhou is a prefecture-level city, which is a higher status than Shengzhou.\n- Shengzhou is a county-level city, part of the prefecture-level city of Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province and has a lower status compared to Suzhou."

The front door would open directly into the first room, which was typically used as a living room or parlor. Behind this room, there would be one or more bedrooms. The kitchen was usually located at the back of the house. This arrangement allowed for good airflow, which was important for cooling the house in the hot southern summers.\n\nThe houses were often built close together, with narrow side yards.

The term \"hostile agents\" is not typically used to describe individuals involved in this crisis. However, if we interpret \"hostile agents\" as individuals or groups that contributed to the crisis or posed challenges to resolving it, we could mention human traffickers who exploited desperate migrants, or political figures and groups within EU countries who opposed accepting refugees. It's important to note that the majority of those arriving in the EU during this time were desperate refugees fleeing conflict and hardship, not \"hostile agents.\""
