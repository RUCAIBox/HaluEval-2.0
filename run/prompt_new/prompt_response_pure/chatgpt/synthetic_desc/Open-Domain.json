Wait, you might be thinking, wasn't Roentgen a physicist known for his discovery of X-rays? Well, you're right! My apologies for the confusion. The correct answer to your question is Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nWassily Kandinsky, born on December 16, 1866, was a Russian painter and art theorist who played a crucial role in the development of abstract art. While he initially pursued a career in law and economics, Kandinsky's passion for art led him to study painting in Munich, Germany. He became one of the pioneers of the abstract art movement known as Expressionism and later co-founded the Blue Rider movement.\n\nKandinsky's artistic approach was heavily influenced by his synesthesia, a condition where one sensory experience triggers another. He believed that colors and shapes had inherent spiritual and emotional qualities, and sought to express these through his abstract compositions. Kandinsky's work marked a significant departure from traditional representational art, as he aimed to evoke emotions and spiritual experiences through non-representational forms.\n\nHis groundbreaking contributions to modern art and his exploration of the spiritual aspects of painting have made Kandinsky one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. His legacy continues to inspire and shape the world of abstract art to this day."
