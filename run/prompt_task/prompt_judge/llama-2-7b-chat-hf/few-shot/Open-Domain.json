To answer your question, I need to provide some background information on Alison Moyet and her music.\nAlison Moyet is a British singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the 1980s with her unique blend of pop, soul, and R&B. She had several hit singles during this time, including \"Is This Love,\" \"Love Resurrection,\" and \"All Cried Out.\"\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a late summer hit by Alison Moyet that reached a specific position on the Billboard Top 100.

He was one of the key figures in the German Expressionist movement, which emerged in the early 20th century. Von Frey's paintings are characterized by their bold, expressive brushstrokes and their use of vibrant colors. He often depicted abstracted, biological forms, blurring the boundaries between art and science.\nVon Frey's work was influenced by the ideas of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, and he saw his art as a way to explore the unconscious mind and the hidden forces of nature. He believed that art and science were complementary fields, and that an understanding of the natural world could be gained through both.\nThroughout his career, von Frey exhibited his work widely, both in Germany and internationally, and he was recognized as one of the leading figures in the German Expressionist movement.
