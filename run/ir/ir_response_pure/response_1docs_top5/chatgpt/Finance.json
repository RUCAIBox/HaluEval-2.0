This does not involve borrowing money that needs to be repaid, but rather giving up a portion of ownership in the company.\nIn summary, the main difference between the two is that a protected-equity loan is a form of debt financing while an equity loan involves selling ownership in the company."

Additionally, the company can also issue new shares through a private placement to specific investors, which does not affect the value held by existing shareholders."
