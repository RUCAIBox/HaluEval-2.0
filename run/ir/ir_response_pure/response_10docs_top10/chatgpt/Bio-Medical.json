    "chatgpt_response": "The interaction between Hof1 and Cyk3 in yeast is important for cleavage-furrow ingression and primary-septum formation during cytokinesis. It is mediated by a direct binding of the Hof1 SH3 domain to a proline-rich motif in Cyk3 and occurs specifically at the time of cytokinesis. This interaction is dispensable for the normal localization of both proteins but is crucial for the proper coordination of cytokinesis processes. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that Hof1 and Cyk3 play distinct roles in septum formation downstream of Iqg1/Mlc1, and that yeast cells can tolerate either loss of the actomyosin ring or a partial defect in septum formation, but not both."
