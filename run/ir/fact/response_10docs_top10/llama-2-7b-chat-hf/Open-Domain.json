The documents also mention that emerging data sources, such as mobile phone data and social media data, can be used to improve the accuracy of pedestrian and cyclist predictions.\n3. The documents do not provide a specific length for the cyclist/pedestrian path that accesses the Melbourne Zoo.\nBased on these points, we can conclude that the length of the cyclist/pedestrian path that accesses the Melbourne Zoo is not available in the provided documents.

The user has come across the terms :last-child, :last-of-type, and :first-child, and is unsure of how to use them.\nTo answer the user's question, I would explain that :last-child is a CSS pseudo-class that selects the last child element of a parent element. The syntax for using :last-child is as follows:\n`css :last-child { /* styles here */ }`\nFor example, if you have the following HTML structure:\n```html\n<div>\n  <p>This is the first paragraph.</p>\n  <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>\n  <p>This is the third paragraph.</p>\n</div>\n```\nAnd you want to style the last child paragraph, you can use the following CSS:\n```css\ncss :last-child {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n```\nThis will apply a red background color to the last child paragraph.\nIt's important to note that :last-child only works on elements that are direct children of a parent element. If you have a nested structure, you will need to use a more specific selector to target the last child element.\nAlternatively, you can use :last-of-type to select the last element of a specific type. The syntax for :last-of-type is as follows:\n`css :last-of-type { /* styles here */ }`\nFor example, if you want to style the last paragraph of a specific type, you can use the following CSS:\n```css\ncss :last-of-type p {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n```\nThis will apply a red background color to the last paragraph of the \"p\" type.\nI hope this helps clarify how to use :last-child and :last-of-type in CSS.

These methods can help reduce the environmental impact of food production, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.\nIn addition, there is likely to be an increase in the use of alternative proteins, such as insects, cultured meat, and plant-based alternatives to meat. These options can help reduce the environmental impact of food production and meet the growing demand for protein.\nThe future of food is also likely to involve a greater emphasis on customized diets and personalized nutrition, with the help of advanced technologies such as genetic testing and nutrigenomics. This could lead to a more tailored approach to food production and consumption, with a focus on individual nutritional needs and preferences.\nFurthermore, there is likely to be a growing trend towards locally-sourced and seasonal foods, as well as a greater emphasis on food waste reduction and recycling. This could involve the use of advanced technologies, such as food waste recycling and composting, to reduce the amount of food that is wasted.\nFinally, the future of food is likely to involve a greater focus on the cultural and social aspects of food, with a greater emphasis on community-based food systems and the role of food in bringing people together.

However, it also mentions that smoking of cannabis is by far the most common way of consumption, but a significant part of medicinal users consume it in the form of a tea. This suggests that cannabis can be consumed as a tea, and Catananche is one of the plants that is commonly used for this purpose.\nCatananche, also known as Catnip, is a perennial herb that is native to Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and chrysanthemums. Catananche contains a chemical called nepetalactone, which is responsible for its medicinal properties. Nepetalactone is a terpene, which is a type of organic compound that is found in plants and gives them their unique aromas and flavors.\nIn contrast, Berlandiera is a genus of flowering plants that is native to the Americas.
