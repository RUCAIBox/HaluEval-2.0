If you look at a picture of a Hawkmoth, you will see that its compound eyes are made up of many small eyes. Each small eye is called a ommatidium.

I’m excited to share my thoughts on this topic.\nAs you know, cancer is the second leading cause of death in women worldwide, and the most common cause of death from cancer among women under 50 years old. In the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer among women, following only lung cancer. In 2017, there were an estimated 27,500 new cases of cancer among women in the U.S., and 3,600 deaths from cancer.\nThe incidence of cancer is higher in African American women than white women. This may be due to differences in risk factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking. However, it is also possible that there are underlying genetic factors that make African American women more susceptible to cancer.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a time to chat further.\nThanks again,\n[Your Name]",
