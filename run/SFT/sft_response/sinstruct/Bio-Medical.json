It does this by binding to a receptor on the surface of the host cell, and then entering the cell through a process called endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the KP4 protein disrupts the cell's internal structure, causing it to rupture. This allows the virus to spread throughout the body."

It was first described in Bacillus subtilis, but has since been observed in many other species. The mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a number of different factors. These include the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the cell, which can damage DNA and cause mutations. ROS are produced by several different enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. These enzymes convert superoxide (O2-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is then broken down into water and oxygen by peroxidases. H2O2 can also be converted into hydroxyl radicals (·OH) by iron-sulfur proteins. These radicals can then damage DNA directly, or react with other molecules to form more complex radicals. In addition to ROS, other factors that have been implicated in stationary-phase mutagenesis include the production of proteolytic enzymes, which can cleave DNA, and the production of antibiotics, which can kill competing bacteria."
