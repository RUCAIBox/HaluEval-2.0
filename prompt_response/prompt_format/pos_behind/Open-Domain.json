This type of glass is ideal for cocktails that are made with a mixer, such as soda water or juice, and are meant to be served in large quantities.\nOn the other hand, the Matador is typically served in a rocks glass, which is a shorter, wider glass with a larger opening. This type of glass is ideal for cocktails that are made with a spirit and a small amount of mixer, such as a splash of juice or a dash of bitters. The larger opening of the rocks glass allows for a more generous pour, which is important for cocktails that are meant to be served in smaller quantities.\nSo, to summarize, the Bananarita is typically served in a highball glass, while the Matador is typically served in a rocks glass."
